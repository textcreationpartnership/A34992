            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:52962:3"/> is, by letting ſuch know, That I was obliged in duty to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; a piece of which will be, to perform what I know would have been his will, even bequeath this his VVork to you, upon whom he never thought his Labour ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Beſides, the Book being Motherleſs, it pitied me it ſhould be Fatherleſs too; and therefore I thought it better to run the hazard of a harſh cenſure, then that this poor Orphane ſhould be expoſed to the wide World, without either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother to fawn upon it. I ſhould not have preſumed to have troubled you with the Tuition of this Child, but that I know you did Reverence and Reſpect the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Perſon; and therefore I hope

I need not ſay any thing in the behalf of this Treatiſe: though it be but young, newly come into the World, I doubt not but it's ſufficient to ſpeak for it ſelf. One Paradox (Indeed) I find in it: The Author writes againſt Uſury; and none improved his Talent more then he; yet no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: his Uſury was not biting: the improvement of this Talent was not to the detriment, but advantage of others: the Church of God, I hope, will be improved by that
<pb facs="tcp:52962:4"/> improvement he hath made. And that your Honour and your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips may reap ſome benefit to your Souls by this his Labour, ſhall be the real Prayers of him,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Being deſired to give my Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, concerning that Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and my worthy Friend, Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Cartwright,</hi> and his learned Commentary on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Pſalm; I was eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereunto, there being in his lifetime an intimate League of Friendſhip between us, and he being one of rare Accompliſhments.</p>
            <p>Not long after my publiſhing of my firſt Book, of the <hi>Divine Promiſes,</hi> I had the happineſs to be acquainted with him; and he told me of a little miſtake in one paſſage at the beginning thereof, which was corrected in the ſecond Edition. I growing more and more familiar with him, and perceiving his great Abilities, made him ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the<note n="*" place="margin">He was a Grammarian under <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> of ſo exact a Judgement, that no Verſe was eſteemed <hi>Homers,</hi> but what he had allowed.</note> 
               <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> of my Labours, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to his judicial peruſal, before I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed them to the World.</p>
            <p>Obſerving his great skill in the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I urged him to bend his Studies that way, for the better elucidating of ſome part of the Old Teſtament. He ſending two of his Sermons
<pb facs="tcp:52962:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> up to <hi>London</hi> to me, written with his own hand, I cauſed them, unknown to him, to be printed; and in the Epiſtle gave Notice of a worthy Work he had in hand on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> wherein the World ſhould perceive his skill (ſaid I then, for which he after blamed me) in the Oriental Tongues, though I ſhould have ſaid, In the Hebrew Language and Rabbines:<note n="†" place="margin">Of which work he himſelf thus wrote to me in a Letter, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> to <hi>Druſius, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè expedit ut quae in libello hoc non vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia tractavi, non ignorari:</hi> For the New Teſtament (which takes up almoſt half the Book) it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any thing in that kind. <hi>Druſius</hi> ſeems to have applyed himſelf that way, yet either ſaw not, or had not leaſure to peruſe either <hi>Bereſhith Rabba, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſh Tillim,</hi> or <hi>Midraſhin:</hi> there is one long Chapter of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophthegm's</hi> found in Jewiſh Writers.</note> which paſſage of mine, haſtned his Annotations on <hi>Geneſis;</hi> which with thoſe on <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,</hi> and alſo his * <hi>Mellificium Hebraicum</hi> (when it comes forth in the Appendix of the <hi>Bibliotheca Criticorum</hi>) abundantly ſhew his accurate Knowledge of the Hebrew Language and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

               </gap>, putting him on thoſe Studies wherein his Excellencie lay; ſo I, by my intereſt in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> procured him the uſe of ſome rare Hebrew Books, very uſeful for the carrying on of his Deſigne; and alſo bought of <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> three He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Books for him, very beneficial for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>As he was ſingularly expert in the Hebrew, ſo he was very skilful both in the Latine and Greek. He wrote an Elegant Latine ſtile, and with eaſe, as his Latine Epiſtles frequently written by him will Evidence. For the Greek, his Works in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhew his skill therein; and there is yet a Divine Living in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> to whom he was uſed to write in Greek. His Engliſh Books are all uſeful in their kinds.</p>
            <p>For poſitive Divinity, the two Sermons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:52962:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> mentioned, his others unprinted, and his double Expoſition of the Apoſtles Creed, ſhew his Ability therein; the larger whereof would be more compleat, if thoſe Sermons he once ſent up for the ſupplying of ſome things he had omitted, were annexed thereunto. For Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical Divinity, not onely his Rejoynder to the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> but two other Autographs of his, which I have ſeen, ſhew his Knowledge therein. For Expoſitory Divinity, this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Laborious Work on the fifteenth Pſalm, ſhews him to be a good Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; wherein (as Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> before him, upon that very Pſalm) he diſcuſſeth accurately that great and moſt vexed Controverſie of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; and both removes the ſeveral ſhifts and pretences made for it, and alſo ſhews the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs thereof by ſtrong and evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>One that reads his Writings, or heard him Preach, might eaſily ſee, he was both copious and pertinent in Scripture-Quotations; a Gift in which Mr. <hi>Arthur Hilderſham,</hi> that eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, excelled.</p>

            <p>THe name of the Reverend and Learned Authour prefixed to this Treatiſe, with thoſe other works of his publiſhed by himſelf in his life-time, might ſave the Labour of any Epiſtle or Preface thereunto, as being ſufficient to recommend it unto the Church of God. But becauſe Editions of Books are lyable to prejudice and diſadvantage in their entertainment, it was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not unneceſſary that ſomething of this nature ſhould lead forth this Book into the world; which ſervice, at the deſire of a Friend, I have readily undertaken, that ſo I might expreſs that true reſpect I always had unto the Author, in bearing his Book after him. And firſt, let me aſſure thee, That theſe enſuing Sermons on the fifteenth Pſalm, are the genuine iſſue of him, whoſe name they bear; being by himſelf prepared for the Preſs, and wholly printed before his death. And this, thoſe that knew him, will believe for the very works ſake, which is a true reſemblance of the Author, learned and plain, critical and practical.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52962:7"/>
            <p>There are indeed other Pictures of his (for Books may be fitly ſo termed) as his learned <hi>Annotations</hi> on <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Exodus,</hi> his <hi>Polemical Rejoynder</hi> to the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Worceſter:</hi> But this Piece, as I conceive, renders him more to the life, then any of the reſt; for he lived this Treatiſe, as well as wrote it. In this Age, wherein ſo many are offended, it's poſsible that ſome may ſtumble at the divine Zeal of the Authors mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Method; but let ſuch conſider, that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a High-way to the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Holy Hill.</hi> If any be weary of its plainneſs, there are difficulties in the Margent to refreſh him. He that brings me good tydings, let him with <hi>Ahimaaz, Run the way of the plain,</hi> I ſhall have them ſo much the ſooner. For my own part, I look upon this work as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly-learned ſeaſonable Call from diſputes to duties; from libertine wandrings, to regular walkings: and if there were no more in it, then the producing and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much Scripture upon the account of Truth and Holineſs, it were ſufficient to recommend it unto a right-ſpirited Chriſtian, who rejoyces in the word, as one that findeth great ſpoyl: But there is much more, as thou wilt finde in the peruſal; to which, with a bleſſing, I leave thee, and remain</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Age, of ſo many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Editions of Books, he that publiſheth an Author, ought to be a true friend to Piety, faithful and honeſt to the memory of the Deceaſed; more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if as good men, we conſider how Popery and Hereſie, prophaneſs and carnal mindedneſs, by many unworthy Obtruders on the Preſs, have crept into the World: for the Churches ſake, theſe ſpiritual Aides ſhould be communicated, but not againſt the Church; ſo that it will appear, To be excellent Wiſdom in Chriſtians that bear a true Zeal to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="tcp:52962:8"/> to conſider how men have lived, as well as how they have writ. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author of this enſuing Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was deſcended from honeſt and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Parents, born in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> the <hi>Belfrank,</hi> called <hi>Belfrers,</hi> within the City of <hi>York:</hi> he was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the firſt day of <hi>October,</hi> in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſix hundred and two; his Education was under pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Schoolmaſters, from whom being accompliſht for the Univerſity of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> there he was fellow of Peter-houſe, and took his Degrees, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there about fifteen years, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf ſo regularly, that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed honour and reſpect from the moſt learned men in his time; and when that he was called to any publick exerciſe, he commanded the Emulation, if not the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all his Auditors. After ſome removes, as the tranſactions of our lives are various, his preaching of the Word at <hi>Cambridge, Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> for the ſpace of thirty years; in the laſt of
<pb facs="tcp:52962:8"/> which places, for his happy ſettlement, it pleaſed the divine Providence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this fruitful Plant of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, a painful paſtor in the Church of Saint <hi>Martins,</hi> in the City of <hi>York,</hi> where for many years he diſcharged his bleſſed employment from heaven, with ſuch Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Integrity, and learned Elocution, that his death at this time is bewailed of all good men, as the greateſt loſs that hath for many years befallen that County. I muſt not forget what Doctor <hi>Collins</hi> ſpoke prophetically of him, in reſpect of his early proficiency in the Oriental Tongues, That if it pleaſed God to bleſs him with years, he would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Ornament to the Nation: which hath been verified in his ſince prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Works, his Expoſition of the Creed, his <hi>Electa Thargumica Rabbinica,</hi> Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as alſo on <hi>Exodus,</hi> with other Works of his which at this time are extant, both in Latine and Engliſh. And that the true love he bore to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the honour of his Country, might
<pb facs="tcp:52962:9"/> not to be forgotten, he inlarged himſelf according to his ability, for the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the large Bible in the Languages lately printed. It pleaſed God to bleſs him with life to finiſh this Commentary; the Sheets whereof he conſtantly received from the Preſs, and corrected them with his own hands: When after ten weeks more violent ſickneſs of a Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, death ſeized him, he was gathered to his Fathers, at ſix and fifty, the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterical year, as he called it, of his Age. He lies buried in the Church of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> where he continued ſo long in his Miniſtry. That learned and religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Jeſus Chriſt, Mr <hi>Edward Bowles,</hi> preacht his funeral Sermon, which was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively heard, and drew tears from moſt of the Auditors; he gave an honourable account of the deceaſed; he took his Text out of the ſecond of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the fourth Chapter, the ſeventh and eighth verſes; <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a crown of
<pb facs="tcp:52962:9"/> righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge, ſhall give me at that day: and not unto me onely, but unto them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> Amongſt other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable expreſſions in his Sermon, he touched on three things which he deſired himſelf and his Brethren might imitate him in: his Sobriety, his Induſtry, and the plainneſs of his preaching; for though he had read more Books then many of of us have heard of, yet he did not crowd his Sermons ſo much with Quotations of Authors, as not to prefer the bleſſed Scripture infinitely before them: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alluding to the words of his Text, he ſhewed how he kept the faith in his learned Expoſitory way of his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Exodus;</hi> in a Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical way, by his Anſwer to the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter;</hi> in a practical way, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life and Converſation.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe Mr: <hi>Carthwright</hi>'s al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dying requeſt, to ſome of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Labourers in the Goſpel, That they would be pleaſed to have an eye to the
<pb facs="tcp:52962:10"/> publiſhing of this Volume, which to the joy of all good Chriſtians, we now ſee extant. Thus much may be ſaid of his learned ſtudies. As touching the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame of his ſpirit, his holy life and converſation was ſufficiently well known to all thoſe that favoured the ways of God: he was a burning and a ſhining Light; the ſparks of his Piety did fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to all the corners of this Kingdom: This bleſſed <hi>Elias,</hi> after he had ſerved his Generation, being taken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>For his perſon, though he was worn out with his ſtudies, yet one might read Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in his face. He was a man unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed, conſtant in his principles, of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and well-balanced temper: he was an excellent Caſuiſt, which from the acknowledgment of ſome weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Friends of his and mine, I can confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſert, in this bleſſed practice for the quieting of the Conſcience, That he did not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax; but like the
<pb facs="tcp:52962:10"/> good Samaritan, poured Oyl into the wounds of the afflicted Saints: yet withal, he was of ſo auſtere, but rectifyed a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that where he found a neceſſity, he knew how to launce and cauterize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having himſelf to weak Chriſtians, more like an Angel then a Man; he obſerved the dayly paſſages of his own life; and in reſpect of the infirmity of his Body, and troubles of his Mind, he was much exerciſed with ſpiritual Conflicts, which I ſhall onely inſtance in one expreſſion of his; Many men, ſaid he, think if they live civilly, they have no need of a Chriſt; I finde great need of a Chriſt. He was ſo truly ſenſible of his own and others miſeries, that all thoſe that rightly knew him, did acknowledge him to be a perſon fitted for holy employments, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his much communion with God, and acquaintance with his own heart. He was learned with and without Books, as he had a ſharp a Wit, and a ſearching Judgement: his manner of handling of Queſtions in this Commentary, is often
<pb facs="tcp:52962:11"/> by Shool-Arguments on both ſides, <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> Concluſions and Anſwers, in which the Reader ſhall finde how he could aſſent in leſſer things, and with a weighty and ſerious reſpect, maintain greater matters. In all, he ſhewed an excellent moderation. The Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> by this time, are ſufficiently ſenſible what want there hath been of a particular Commentary on this Pſalm, ſo few Authors having addreſſed their Studies this way; which want is now fully ſupplyed by this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, Learned, Religious Divine, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us both Practical and Polemical Expoſitions of it, ſo ſpiritually and adviſedly, that I cannot but acknowledge that I have not met with any of our late Writers that have excelled him in theſe abilities; inſomuch that thoſe that rightly knew him, believe this to be the Epitome of his many years Studies. An eminently learned Divine, a Friend of his and mine, peruſing this Book in the Manuſcript, obſerving how he conſulted with the Original, ſaid, That the Lord had endued this Author with excellent and peculiar Gifts, in a ſhort, yet ſubſtantial way, to render the meaning of the Scripture. To conclude: Learned and Religious Reader, my Prayers are to God for his Bleſſing, that this Work of our Friend, now in Heaven, may do good to the future Generations, that they may have cauſe to ſend up many thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings to the Father of Mercies, for the benefit they have reapt by it: ſo prayeth the <hi>Quondam</hi> fellow Pupill of the deceaſed Author.</p>

In the firſt Verſe of the Pſalm we are in hand with, <hi>David</hi> calls the Tabernacle, and the Hill, which he ſpeaks of, the Lord's Tabernacle, and his Hill; good reaſon therefore, why he ſhould (as he doth) conſult the Lord, and ask of him, how he ſhould be ſo qualified as to be admitted into it, and ſo abide and dwell in it for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But (may ſome ſay) how doth God teach and inſtruct?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, God doth teach and inſtruct both by his Word, and by his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his Word, as the outward means. It is true, The Light of Nature may afford ſome knowledge of God. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his handy-work. Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge. There is no ſpeech nor lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, where their voice is not heard,</hi> Pſal. 19.1, 2, 3. <hi>That, which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them. For the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52962:13"/> by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1.19, 20. But ſuch knowledge, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and neceſſary unto Salvation, cannot be had by the Light of Nature, but the Light of God's Word is it by which it muſt be attained. <hi>In Judah is God known,</hi> Pſal. 76.1. to wit, becauſe in <hi>Judah</hi> they had the Oracles of God committed unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. As for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that were without the word, they were even <hi>without God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2.12. without the true ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; <hi>the Gentiles, which know not God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.5. <hi>Salvation is of the Jews,</hi> ſaid our Saviour to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to wit, becauſe the Jews onely had the Word of God, which doth ſhew the Way of Salvation. <hi>David</hi> therefore having ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whom thou chaſtenest, O Lord;</hi> he adds, <hi>and teacheſt him out of thy law,</hi> Pſal. 94.12. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. <hi>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths.</hi> And v. 130. <hi>The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth underſtanding to the ſimple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By his Spirit, as the inward and principal Agent. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,</hi> Jer. 31.33. This God doth by his Spirit; <hi>I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> ſaith he, Ezek. 36.27. <hi>Ye are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declared to be the epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhy tables of the heart,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the Corinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. Chriſt by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did open the underſtandings of his Diſciples, that they might underſtand the Scriptures, <hi>Luk</hi> 24.45. And by his Spirit he opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to attend unto the things which were ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 16.14.</p>
               <p>This then ſerves firſt to convince all ſuch, as think to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> promote and further their Salvation by obſerving and practizing ſuch things as God never taught them, but they themſelves or others for them, have deviſed. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are moſt groſs in this kind, the moſt of their Religion being Superſtition, and the greateſt part of their Worſhip being will-Worſhip. Their Croſſes and Holy-Waters,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52962:14"/> their Pilgrimages and Images, their praying in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, and praying unto Saints; theſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch-like things as theſe, they ſet much by, and think they pleaſe God and profit themſelves by them, whenas yet God hath taught them no ſuch matter. Juſtly may that be ſaid to them, which Chriſt ſaid to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,</hi> Mar. 7.7. But to let them paſs, ſome among our ſelves are very preciſe, in obſerving and practizing divers things, as pleaſing unto God, and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their own Souls, for which they have no inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor direction at all from God; as their coming faſting to the Lord's Table, their abſtaining from certain Meats at certain times, and the like. Yea, although they do obſerve thoſe things which God doth teach and require, yet they do it not upon that ground, but upon the ſame ground, that they obſerve other things which God did never teach nor require.</p>
               <p>The moſt that they have to alledge for what they do, is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Cuſtom, the Example of their fore-Fathers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers among whom they live. But when the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid, <hi>Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain,</hi> Joh. 4.20. our Saviour anſwered, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what, v.</hi> 22. And when the Phariſees taxed Chriſt's Diſciples for not obſerving the tradition of the Elders, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.5. Chriſt taxed them, ſaying, <hi>Laying aſide the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the waſhing of pots and cups, and many other ſuch-like things ye do,</hi> v. 8. And <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us that Chriſt hath redeemed us from our vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation received by tradition from our fathers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Good intent and meaning; hereupon they think God will accept that which they do, though they know no ground or warrant at all from God for it. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Uzzah</hi> may ſufficiently ſhew what a broken reed this is to lean upon. He had a good intent and meaning in that which he did, when he put forth his hand, and laid hold on the Ark; for he thought only to ſtay it, and to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52962:14"/> keep it from falling, when he ſaw that the Oxen did ſhake the Cart wherein it was carried; yet God was ſo far from being pleaſed with that which he did, that immediately he ſmote him, that he died for it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.9, 10. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſhews the reaſon of God's inflicting this judgement, ſaying, <hi>The Lord our God made a breach upon us, becauſe we ſought him not after the due order,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. It is not enough therefore to ſeek God, but we muſt know how we do it, we muſt do it after the due order, that is, ſo as God himſelf hath preſcribed. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth of himſelf, ſaying, <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things againſt the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> Act 26.9. It was out of his zeal, (he ſaith) that he did perſecute the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. But was that therefore which he did, pleaſing unto God? No, becauſe his zeal was ſuch as he ſpeaketh of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. where he ſaith of the Jews, <hi>They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</hi> So our Saviour told his Diſciples, that the time would come, when they that killed them, would think they did God ſervice, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. Yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, God would be far from accepting ſuch ſervice. That ſervice which is acceptable unto God, muſt be <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. it muſt proceed firſt from the Underſtanding, the prime and principal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the reaſonable Soul; and then from the Will and Affections, which are reaſonable only by participation. <hi>Be ye not unwiſe, but underſtand what the will of the Lord is,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.17. Whatever ſervice it be that is performed without Underſtanding, it is but <hi>the ſacrifice of fools,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> terms it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. And, as he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>God hath no pleaſure in fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This makes for the reproof of ſuch as regard <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> not to learn of God, though he affords them time and means, whereby to attain to the knowledge of Salvation, yet they heed not to make uſe of them. How juſtly may we complain of many, <hi>When for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again, which be the firſt principles of the oracles of God?</hi> Heb. 5.12. Yea,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52962:15"/> many are not only ignorant, but (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>they are willingly ignorant,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.5. <hi>They ſay unto God, Depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſays of the wicked, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. How do they think to be ſaved, who are ſo ignorant, and ſtill will be ignorant of thoſe things which concern Salvation; who neither know theſe things, nor care to know them? The Apoſtle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that whom God will have to be ſaved, them alſo he will have to come to the knowledge of the Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. ſo that without coming to the knowledge of the Truth, no coming to Salvation. Knowledge is <hi>the key,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.52. So that if thou haſt no knowledge, the Gate of Salvation is faſt ſhut and lock'd, there is no entrance for thee. <hi>My people is deſtroyed for lack of knowledge,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.4. The very want of knowledge is enough to cauſe deſtruction, how much more the contempt of it? <hi>This is the condemnation of the world,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather then light,</hi> Joh. 3.19. What will they here ſay? That God is merciful, and will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on them? ſo ſome uſe to ſpeak in this, and the like caſe: but what ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah? It is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour,</hi> Iſa. 27.11.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> Thirdly and laſtly, here is Exhortation for all to learn of God; and to that end,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to learn of God.</note>1. To acquaint themſelves well with God's Word; for that is the ordinary means whereby God doth teach thoſe things which concern Salvation, as I have ſhewed before.<note place="margin">Diſce cor Dei ex verbis Dei, <hi>Gregor.</hi>
                  </note> Therefore conſult God's Word, give heed unto it, and follow it. <hi>Thy word have I hid within my heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> unto God) <hi>that I might not ſin against thee,</hi> Pſal. 119.11. And <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Thy testimonies alſo are my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and my counſellours.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 99. <hi>I have more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding then all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To pray unto God for his Spirit to enlighten the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52962:15"/> minde, and to enable to underſtand his Word, and to profit by it: for (as I have alſo ſhewed before) the Spirit is the principal Agent, without which the Word is of no force, of no effect. As ordinarily without the Word, the Spirit doth not work; and therefore the Word is not to be ſlighted and deſpiſed: ſo without the Spirit, the Word cannot poſſibly work; and therefore the Word is not to be reſted in, but the Spirit is to be prayed for, that ſo the Word may be effectual. Though the Word be a Light, yet except our eyes be opened, what are we the better for it? This <hi>David</hi> conſidered, and therefore prayed unto God, ſaying, <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,</hi> Pſal. 119.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To labour for ſuch a diſpoſition and frame of heart, as God requires in thoſe whom he will teach.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore we muſt be humble, acknowledging our wants and imperfections, our inability to help our ſelves, and our unworthineſs, that God ſhould help us. <hi>A ſcorner</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) ſeeketh wiſdom, and findeth it not; but knowledge is eaſie to him that underſtandeth;</hi> to wit, that underſtandeth what is requiſite for the obtaining of it: <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.6.<note place="margin">Humilitatis eſt totius ſpiritualis fabricae funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum. <hi>Bern. Epiſt. 87.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Seeſt thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a man wiſe in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool then of him,</hi> Prov. 26.12. More hope of any fool, then of a proud ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited fool. <hi>Profeſſing themſelves wiſe,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they became fools,</hi> Rom. 1.22. And therefore he bids, <hi>Let no man deceive himſelf: if any man among you ſeem to be wiſe in this world, let him become a fool,</hi> (let him know and acknowledge himſelf to be ſo) <hi>that he may be wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.18. Such a diſpoſition <hi>Agur</hi> was of: <hi>Surely,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am more bruitiſh then man, and have not the underſtanding of a man: I neither learned wiſdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy,</hi> Prov. 30.2, 3. The want of this diſpoſition was it that made the Phariſees ſo blinde, they thought that none were ſo acute and quick-ſighted as they were. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.16, 24, 26. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.34, 39, 40, 41.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52962:16"/>2. We muſt be pliable and obedient, ready to do the will of God when it is made known unto us. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? him will he teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe,</hi> Pſal. 25.12. And <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his covenant.</hi> This God promiſeth, ſaying, <hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God,</hi> Pſal. 50.23. It is true, God muſt firſt teach us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can do any thing aright, or have any purpoſe to do it: but as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>To him that hath</hi> (that is, maketh good uſe of what he hath) <hi>ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance,</hi> Mat. 25.29. <hi>David</hi> therefore, praying unto God to teach him, profeſſeth his readineſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and practice what he ſhall learn of him. <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes; and I will keep it unto the end. Give me underſtanding, and I will keep thy law: yea, I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.33, 34.</p>

The Church is termed a Tabernacle, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe from <hi>Moſes</hi> unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> God was ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhipped in a Tabernacle, and in it was placed the Ark, the ſign of God's ſpecial preſence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7 2. in which latter place it is ſaid, <hi>The ark of God dwelleth within curtains,</hi> that is, in a Tabernacle hung about, and covered with Curtains: Or, becauſe a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle is ſometimes put for any Habitation, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.3. <hi>I will not come into the tabernacle of my houſe:</hi> and the Church is God's Habitation, <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. God doth dwell in it, <hi>as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. In this reſpect, the Church may be called a Tabernacle, as there (to wit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.) it is called a Temple, yet ſtill (as it ſeemeth) with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Jewiſh Tabernacle, which <hi>Moſes</hi> erected, wherein God did dwell, in that there he did in ſpecial manifeſt himſelf unto his people. Again, the word <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> ſignifying (as we ſee) any Habitation, even the Houſe or Palace of a King (for ſo it is uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.3.) by God's Tabernacle here may be meant Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God doth dwell, that is, wherein he doth eſpecially manifeſt and ſhew forth his Glory. <hi>Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Prayer to God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.30.

See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.2. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.22. For the other word <hi>hill,</hi> or (as the word in the Original doth properly import) <hi>mountain,</hi>

                  </note> it may alſo either ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Church or Heaven. The Church, in that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built upon a Hill or Mountain, to wit, <hi>Sion;</hi> whence the Church in Scripture is frequently called <hi>Sion,</hi> or <hi>mount Sion,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. or <hi>the mountain of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.2.

So then all the Expoſitions before mentioned are agreeable to the words; and indeed they come all to one in effect.

               <p n="1">1. All are not ſo much as outwardly called to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Salvation. Before Chriſt's coming, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of Salvation were vouchſafed to no Nation of the World, but only one, to wit, the Nation of the Jews. <hi>He hath given his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his ordinances unto Iſrael: he hath not dealt ſo with any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>Salvation is of the Jews,</hi> John 4.22. <hi>In times paſt God ſuffered all nations</hi> (except the Jews) <hi>to walk in their own ways,</hi> Act. 14.16. All that were <hi>aliens from the commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi> were alſo <hi>ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. After Chriſt's coming, though the partition-wall, which was betwixt Jews and Gentiles, was taken away by Chriſt's death, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. So that whereas before Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 10.5. After his death and reſurrection, he bade them, <hi>Go teach all nations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mar. 16.15. Yet ſtill (as experience ſhews, and hath ſhewed in all ages) many in the World are, and have been without the ordinary means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Have they not heard? Yes veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their ſound went out into all the earth, and their words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ends of the world.</hi> And ſo that <hi>Col</hi> 1.6. &amp; 23. where it is ſaid, That the Goſpel was in all the World, and was preached to every creature under Heaven, that (I ſay) muſt either be underſtood thus, that the Goſpel was preached indifferently to Jews and Gentiles, of what Nation or Country ſoever men were: or it is ſpoken hyperbolical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like that <hi>Act.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There were dwelling at Jeruſalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</hi> Thus then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52962:18"/> all are not ſo much as outwardly called; neither again, are all, that are called outwardly, called effectually, they are not all <hi>called according to purpoſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays ſome are, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.28. to wit, God's purpoſe to ſave thoſe whom he doth call. Of this calling the Apoſtle there ſpeaks, <hi>v.</hi> 30. ſaying, <hi>Moreover, whom he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> All that are outwarldly called, are not thus called. No, <hi>Many are called,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>but few are choſen,</hi> Mat. 20.16. and 22.14. Among thoſe that heard the Word, there are divers ſorts of unfruitful and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hearers, as our Saviour ſheweth in the parable of the ſower, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Only ſuch as are in the Church, the viſible Church, are in the ordinary way of Salvation. <hi>The Lord added to the church dayly ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> Act. 2.47. But all are not in the Church, ſo much as by outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: ſome are <hi>without,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.12, 13. Col. 4.5. without the pale of the Church. Many there be in the World, as Jews, Turks, and others, that do not ſo much as outwardly profeſs the Name of Chriſt. And many alſo there be, who profeſſing Chriſt, do yet hold Doctrines quite contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt; as they of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo the Socinians and others. And even of thoſe, that profeſs the Orthodox and ſaving Faith, many there be, who only profeſs it in Word and Tongue, but not in Deed and in Truth. <hi>All are not Iſrael,</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>that are of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9.6. All are not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God indeed, who ſeem to be of the number of them. Chriſt pointed at <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> as a rare man, and worthy to be taken notice of; <hi>Behold, an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile,</hi> John 1, 47. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us,</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> of ſome that proved Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates) <hi>for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.19. In <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark there was a <hi>Cham;</hi> among Chriſt's Apoſtles there was a <hi>Judas;</hi> in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52962:18"/> Primitive Church there was an <hi>Ananias,</hi> and a <hi>Sapphira:</hi> ſo in all Churches there are and will be ſome profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſome hypocrites.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this Point is firſt to convince ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> themſelves that Salvation belongs unto all, as well one as another: ſuch there are; and though the contrary be moſt clear and evident, yet they will not yield unto it, but ſtrive and ſtruggle, argue and object againſt it all they can. <hi>What?</hi> (ſaith they) <hi>hath God made us to deſtroy us? He that made us, will alſo ſave us. Is not God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all? Hath not Chriſt died for all?</hi> Thus (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>they rebel againſt the light,</hi> Job 24.13. Though theſe Objections be frivolous, and not worth the anſwering, yet becauſe <hi>Solomon</hi> bids, <hi>Anſwer a fool ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his folly,</hi> (that is, ſo as that his folly may appear, and that he may be convinced of it) <hi>lest he be wiſe in his own conceit,</hi> Prov. 26.5. therefore I will vouchſafe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them.</p>
               <p>To the firſt Objection, <hi>Hath God made us to deſtroy us?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>God made all things for himſelf, even the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> Prov. 16.4. Not that God doth make men wicked; but they making themſelves ſuch, God in his juſt judgement doth make or ordain them for the day of evil, even of wrath and deſtruction, <hi>Job</hi> 21.30. Had men continued ſuch as God at firſt did make them, to wit, in <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man, they had been far enough from deſtruction: but (alas) they kept not their firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but plunged themſelves into ſin, and ſo into miſery, being born in ſin,<note place="margin">Damnati anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam nati. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. and ſo <hi>the children of wrath by nature,</hi> Eph. 2.3. Thus then whoever periſh, may thank themſelves for it. <hi>O Iſrael, thou hast deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, <hi>He that made us will alſo ſave us:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Not ſo, he that made all, will not ſave all; he might in juſtice have damned all; <hi>for all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23. That any are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaved, it is <hi>freely by his grace,</hi> v. 24. And his Grace
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52962:19"/> being free, he may beſtow it as he pleaſeth; <hi>for who hath given unto him firſt, and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again?</hi> Rom. 11.35.</p>
               <p>To the third, <hi>God is merciful to all:</hi> I anſwer, He is ſo, but not in reſpect of ſaving mercy: No, in this reſpect, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> Rom. 9.18. God is juſt as well as merciful, and he will have the Glory of his Juſtice in the deſerved damnation of ſome, as well as the Glory of his Mercy in the undeſerved Salvation of others.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, <hi>Christ died for all:</hi> I anſwer, Chriſt's death is not available to the Salvation of all. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. And again, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me; for they are thine,</hi> Joh. 17.9. That 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for our ſins only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world:</hi> that (I ſay) is meant, not for the ſins of the Jews only, but for the ſins of the Gentiles alſo, whoever they be throughout the whole World, that believe in him. And ſo all thoſe places of Scripture, where Chriſt is ſaid to be the Saviour of the World, or to have died for all, or the like, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in this manner. <hi>It is a light thing, that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant,</hi> (ſo ſpeaks God unto Chriſt as Man) <hi>to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the diſperſed of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; I have alſo given thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 49.6. Chriſt is there ſaid to be God's Salvation unto the ends of the earth, becauſe not only the Jews, but the Gentiles alſo ſhould enjoy Salvation by him. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> alledged this place of <hi>Eſay,</hi> to prove, that the Goſpel was to be preached not only to the Jews, but alſo to the Gentiles; <hi>Lo, we turn to the Gentiles;</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for ſo hath the Lord commanded, ſaying, I have ſet thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou ſhouldſt be for ſalvation to the ends of the earth,</hi> Act. 13.46, 47. So <hi>Simeon</hi> having ſaid, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace; for mine
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52962:19"/> eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people:</hi> to ſhew how Chriſt is a Salvation prepared of God, before the face of all people, he adds immediately, <hi>To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2.30, 31, 32. Thus alſo the four Beaſts, and the four and twenty Elders, that is, the whole Company of the Redeemed, ſay unto the Lamb, that is, unto Chriſt, <hi>Thou waſt ſlain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation,</hi> Rev. 5.9. Not all of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation; but <hi>us,</hi> that is, ſome out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation. That of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi> is explained by the Apoſtle himſelf in the very next verſe, to be meant not ſimply and abſolutely of all, but of all <hi>that are Chriſts,</hi> that belong unto Chriſt, and are his. All that believe in Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved by him. For <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. But <hi>all have not faith,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.2. No, Faith <hi>is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2 8. And God vouchſafes it not to all, but to ſome, as he pleaſeth. <hi>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake,</hi> Phil. 1.29. Therefore even to believe in Chriſt, is a gift vouchſafed only unto ſome, and not unto all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore this may ſerve to rouze us up out of the <label type="milestone">

No coming to Salvation, but by Chriſt. <hi>There is not ſalvation in any other, neither is there any other name under heaven given among men whereby they may be ſaved,</hi> Act. 4.12. Neither is there any coming unto Chriſt but by Faith; for to come unto him is to believe in him. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; and that we may know what it is to come unto him, he adds immediately, <hi>and he that believeth in me, ſhall never thirſt,</hi> John 6.35.

And (alas) who almoſt is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this reproof? Many with <hi>Martha</hi> are troubled about many things; but few with <hi>Mary</hi> do chuſe the better part, and mind that one thing needful. <hi>Many will ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> as <hi>David</hi> obſerves, <hi>Pſal</hi> 4.6. But what is the good that they take thought for? Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, as <hi>David</hi> there ſhews, <hi>v.</hi> 7. So it is, the profits and pleaſures of this life, theſe are the things that the moſt do ſeek and labour for; as for Salvation and the Life to come, they little think of it, much leſs labour for it: as if either there were no ſuch thing at all, or it were not worth the looking after, or it were ſo eaſie to be acquired, that we need not trouble our ſelves about it. Some when they are even fettered with ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, that they cannot ſtir abroad, yet ſtill their mindes are upon the World, and the things of the World, and they cannot frame their hearts to think ſeriouſly of that World which is to come. If ſuch as come to viſit them, will talk of earthly things, this pleaſeth them; but if they ſpeak of ſpiritual and heavenly matters, they are ſoon weary of ſuch diſcourſe, they are not for it. Yea,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52962:23"/> this is that which makes ſickneſſes and diſeaſes grievous unto them, that now they are diſabled from following their worldly affairs, and their earthly employments; but that they are debarred from God's Ordinances, the means of their Salvation, this little troubles them, they are little ſenſible of any ſuch matter. So old men and women, that (one would think) are paſt the World, that have (as we ſay) one foot in the grave already, even theſe do little take thought how they ſhall live hereafter in the World to come; but as their bodily eyes, ſo the eyes of their minde alſo, are ſo much the more down to the Earth,<note place="margin">O cun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if we be in miſery for the preſent, and have no ſound and well-grounded hope of a better eſtate hereafter, then ſurely we are moſt miſerable. <hi>If in this life only we had hope in Chriſt,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we are of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. To wit, becauſe here in this life of all men the Godly are moſt apt to be afflicted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Death will come. <hi>It is appointed to men to die once,</hi> Heb. 9.27. Now what comfort and courage can we have to die, if we have no well-grounded hope of a better Life when this is ended?

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that it was no marvel if they were ſo little afraid of death, becauſe their life was ſo miſerable: but experience ſhews, that even ſuch as live miſerably would yet live ſtill, and are unwilling to die, becauſe they have ſmall hope to exchange this life for a better. The wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes have little dread of death, they even ruſh upon it; but <hi>furor eſt, non fortitudo,</hi> it is madneſs, not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: <hi>they are blinde, and cannot ſee afar off,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.9. Their blindeneſs is the cauſe of their boldneſs: for if they did but ſee the condition they are in, they could not chuſe but quake and tremble to think of death. <hi>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation ſhall periſh:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">O animula, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, blandula, quae nunc abibis in loca?</note> 
                  <hi>and the hope of unjuſt men periſheth,</hi> Prov. 11.7 <hi>What hope hath the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, though he have gained, when God ſhall take away his ſoul?</hi> Job. 27.8. <hi>The wicked is driven away in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the righteous hath hope in his death,</hi> Prov. 14.32. Indeed, only the Righteous are they that can have true hope in their death; and therefore only they can be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undanted at the approach of death. <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52962:24"/> eternall in the heavens.</hi> And thereupon he addes, <hi>Therefore are we alwayes confident, knowing that whileſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord. (For we walk by faith, and not by ſight.) We are confident, I ſay, willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Deſiring to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp; to be with Chriſt, which is farre better,</hi> Phil. 1.23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Judgment will come. <hi>After death comes judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. A particular judgment in reſpect of the ſoule immediately after death, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22, 23. And at length a generall judgment in reſpect both of ſoule and bodie, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. Now how ſhall we be able to ſtand in judgment, if we doe not now whiles we are here thinke of it, and prepare for it, by working out our ſalvation, and by giving diligence to make our calling and our election ſure? <hi>Wherefore (beloved) ſeeing that you looke for ſuch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot and blameleſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.14. But be admoniſhed to thinke of this betimes, and not to procraſtinate and put it off, as we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to doe, untill ſickneſs or old-age come, as if it were ſoone enough to thinke of another life when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to leave this. 1. This is very prepoſterous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for earth before heaven, for things temporal before things eternal. Our Saviour bids, <hi>First ſeeke ye the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and his righteouſneſs,</hi> Matth. 6.33. The chiefeſt things ſhould have the chiefeſt of our thoughts, cares and indeavours. 2. This is very dangerous; for if ſickneſs and old-age make us unmeet to looke after the things of his life; ſo they will alſo make us unmeet to looke after the things of the life to come. Experience ſhewes this even in the godly themſelves many times, that by reaſon of the ſympathie which is betwixt the ſoule and the body, the diſtempers of the body cauſe a diſtemper in the ſoule alſo, ſo that they can ſcarce think of any thing, but onely how they may be eaſed of that paine, which they are in. This is the reaſon why Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bids, <hi>Remember now thy Creatour in the dayes of thy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52962:24"/> youth, while</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the evill dayes come not, nor the yeares draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.1. The time of old age, and of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a time of ſpending, rather then of getting: and therefore as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the yeares of plentie provided for the yeares of famine; ſo ſhould we in time of youth and health provide for the time of old age and ſickneſs. But beſides, this life is fraile and uncertaine, we may be cut off before either ſickneſs or old age come. <hi>For what is our life? it is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little while, and vaniſheth away,</hi> Jam. 4.14. Therefore (as the Wiſe man doth admoniſh) <hi>Beaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrow; for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. 27.1. <hi>To day if ye will heare his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> Pſal. 95.7, 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How good and gracious the Lord is, in vouchſafing yet to afford time and meanes of ſalvation. <hi>Receive not the grace of God in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. <hi>Yet a little while is the light with you; walke whiles you have the light, lest dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come upon you: he that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth,</hi> Joh 12.35. If we regard not the means, when God affords them, we provoke him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of them. <hi>The Kingdome of God</hi> (ſaid our Saviour to the Jewes) <hi>ſhall be taken from you, and given to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will bring forth the fruits of it,</hi> Mat. 21.43. And 2. we aggravate and increaſe our condemnation. <hi>This is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather then light,</hi> John 3.19. <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin; but now they have no cloak for their ſin,</hi> Joh. 15.22. See Matth. 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>

For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eternall weight of glory. Whiles we looke not at the things which are ſeene, but at the things which are not ſeene: for the things that are ſeene are temporal, but the things which are not ſeene are eternal,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18. <hi>By faith Moſes, when he was come to yeares, refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaohs daughter; Chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches then the treaſures in Egypt: for he had reſpect to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Heb. 11.24, 25, 26.

               <p>The uſe of this point is firſt for Examination, to try our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> ſelves, whether we be thus qualified, as they muſt be that ſhall inherit ſalvation, that is, whether we be upright. Now we muſt know, that hypocriſie, which is oppoſite to uprightneſs, is twofold. 1. There is a groſſe hypocriſie,<note place="margin">There is a twofold hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</note> when one purpoſely doth play the hypocrire, pretending one thing, and intending another thing quite contrary. Such an hypocrite was <hi>Herod,</hi> who pretended that he would goe and worſhip Chriſt, when his intent was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to kill him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. Such alſo was the hypocriſie of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who made a ſhew of much love and reſpect to Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Haile Maſter,</hi> and kiſſing him, and yet he ſought only to betray him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. They that are hypocrites in this kinde, neede onely to abhorre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to repent of their hypocriſie; there is no need that they ſhould examine themſelves, to finde out whether they be upright or no; for they certainly know themſelves to be hypocrites. But 2. there is another kinde of hypocriſie, which is more ſubtil and ſecret: when a man ſpeakes and acts as he thinkes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet his heart is not ſound at the bottome; he is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52962:27"/> like a pond, which is fair and cleare above, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath is full of mud and filth. Such was the hypocriſie of <hi>Jehu,</hi> he thought himſelfe very zealous for God, in deſtroying the worſhippers of Baal; <hi>Come with me</hi> (ſaid he to Jehonadab) <hi>and ſee my zeale for the Lord,</hi> 2 Kin. 10.16. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, verſ. 31.) <hi>Jehu tooke no heede to walke in the law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his heart; for he departed not from the ſinnes of Jeroboam, who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Such an hypocrite alſo was the rich man, that came to our Saviour, deſiring to know what he ſhould doe that he might inherit eternal life. And when our Saviour told him of the commandments, he ſaid, <hi>All theſe have I obſerved from my youth;</hi> he ſpake as he thought, but his heart did deceive him, it was not right in him: For when our Saviour bad him goe and ſell that he had, and give it to the poore, and come and follow him, and he ſhould have treaſure in heaven; he went away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe he had great poſſeſſions; <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.17, &amp;c. Covetouſneſs did reigne in him, though he was not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it; his riches did rather poſſeſſe him, then he them; and therefore rather then he would part with them, he would forſake Chriſt, and let goe heaven and eternal happineſs. Now as uprightneſs is oppoſite to this kinde of hypocriſie, it behooves us to try whether or no we be upright.<note place="margin">Markes of uprightneſs.</note> And if we be, 1. we will have a care to walke ſo, as to pleaſe God in all things, as well in one thing as in another; Wee will <hi>endeavour to walke worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, and to be fruitfull in every good worke,</hi> Col. 1.10. This ſhewed the uprightneſs of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, they walked in all the commandments and teſtimonies of the Lord,</hi> Luke 1.6. By this it did appeare, that <hi>they were righteous before God,</hi> and not before men onely; righteous indeed and in truth, not in ſhew and appearance only. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect to all thy commandments,</hi> ſaith David unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. This having reſpect unto all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ſhewed his heart to be ſound and upright; this ſhewed him to be a man after Gods owne heart, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52962:27"/> for this very reaſon God did terme him, <hi>I have found</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>David the ſon of Ieſſe, a man after mine owne heart, which ſhall fulfill all my will,</hi> Act. 13.22. Such alſo Chriſt doth terme his friends, <hi>You are my friends</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if ye doe whatſoever I command you,</hi> Joh. 15.14. <hi>Herod</hi> went farre, <hi>he did many things,</hi> Mar. 6.20. but he went not farre enough, there was one thing that he would not doe, when <hi>John</hi> told him, that it was not lawfull for him to have his brothers wife, in this he would not heare him. Herein alſo appeared the unſoundneſs of <hi>Iehu's</hi> heart; though he rooted out the idolatrous worſhip of Baal, which <hi>Ahab</hi> brought in, yet he did not turne from the idolatrous worſhip of the calves, which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſet up, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.31. They that are <hi>undefiled</hi> (or upright) in the way, <hi>and ſeeke the Lord with their whole heart, they doe none iniquitie,</hi> Pſal. 119.1, 2, 3. that is, they doe not take libertie to themſelves to doe any iniquitie, <hi>they refraine their feet from every evill way,</hi> Pſal. 119.101. <hi>They hate every falſe way,</hi> verſ. 104. and 128. More particularly, if we be upright, then 1. We will keepe no darling or boſome ſin, either for the profit, or for the pleaſure of it. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> appeared to be upright by this, that when it might have ſeemed advantagious unto him in reſpect of the world, to conſent unto the enticement of his Miſtris, yet he repelled the temptation, ſaying, <hi>How can I doe this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Gen. 39.9.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. and 26.</note> So when <hi>David</hi> might have killed <hi>Saul,</hi> and have freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from much trouble and danger, which by reaſon of <hi>Sauls</hi> perſecuting of him, he was liable to, yet he would not doe it; this ſhewed, that his heart was upright with God. To this, his behaviour toward <hi>Saul,</hi> he ſeemeth to have reference, when he ſaith, <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſneſs, according to the cleanneſs of of mine hands hath he recompenced me. For I have kept the wayes of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his ſtatutes from me. I was alſo upright before him, and kept my ſelfe from mine iniquitie,</hi> Pſal. 18.20, 21, 22, 23.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52962:28"/> He ſhewed his uprightneſs in this, that he kept himſelf from that iniquity, which reſpect unto outward and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages would eſpecially have put him upon. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and ſuch as whoſe hearts are not ſincere, though they will avoid ſome ſinnes, yet not ſuch as whereby they have their gaine, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſaid to his fellow crafts-men concerning the worſhip of <hi>Diana,</hi> Act. 19.25. <hi>Iehu</hi> could well ſpare the idolatrie of Baal, and theref re he put d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wne that; but he kept up the idolatrie of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> calves; for he thought if he ſhould let the people goe to Jeruſalem to worſhip there (as they ought to have done) then they would fall from him to the king of Judah, and ſo he ſhould loſe his kingdome; for the preventing of which inconvenience, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> firſt ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that idolatrie, as we reade 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.26, &amp;c. So the pleaſure which that ſin brought (and it may be the profit alſo) made <hi>Herod,</hi> that he would not leave his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> though <hi>Iohn</hi> told him never ſo much that it was not lawfull for him to have her, ſhe being his brothers wife.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We will have a care to obſerve even the leaſt thing that God commands. As it is groſſe hypocriſie to be obſervant of leſſer duties, and to neglect the greater: <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, for you pay tithe of mint, and anniſe, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: Theſe things ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blinde guides, which ſtraine at a gnat, and ſwallow a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> Matth. 23.23, 24. So it argues want of ſincerity and uprightneſs, to think any thing commanded of God ſo ſmall, as that it need not to be regarded; to ſay, as ſome uſe to doe, <hi>Is this ſo much? Is this ſo great a matter?</hi> Even the tything of mint, anniſe, and cummin was not to be left undone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 33.23. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of theſe commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo,</hi> (ſhall avow it,<note place="margin">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52962:28"/> he ſhall have no place in it, no admittance into it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We will have a ſpecial care to performe the duties of our ſpecial calling. Some are like <hi>Abſalom, O</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I were judge in the land; I would doe every man right,</hi> 2 Sam. 15 4. When as in the meane time he hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not his owne dutie, that which his owne place and calling did require of him, as the ſtorie there ſheweth. But he that is upright and truely godly, is like a tree, <hi>that bringeth forth his fruit</hi> (his owne proper fruit) <hi>in his ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 1.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we be upright, it will be our care to ſerve and pleaſe God at all times, as well at one time as at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Let thine heart</hi> (ſaith Salomon) <hi>be in the feare of the Lord all the day long,</hi> Prov. 23.17. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As well in ſecret as in publike. <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaking of a hypocrite, ſaith, <hi>Will he call upon God at all times?</hi> Job 27.10. that is, as well at one time as at another. At ſome times he will, namely when others may ſee him, and take notice of him; but at other times when he is alone by himſelf in ſecret, he regardes it not. <hi>Son of man</hi> (ſaith God to Ezekiel) <hi>ſeeſt thou what the ancients of the houſe of Iſrael doe in the darke?</hi> Ezek. 8.12. <hi>It is a ſhame</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>even to ſpeake of thoſe things which are done of them in ſecret,</hi> Epheſ. 5.12. Such as theſe are farre from walking uprightly; they have reſpect to men, and not to God. For God ſees as well what is done in ſecret as in publike. <hi>Can any one hide himſelfe in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? doe not I the Lord fill hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth?</hi> Jer. 23.20. <hi>If I ſay, Surely the darkneſs ſhall cover me; even the night ſhall be light about me. Yea, the darkneſs hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day: the darkneſs and the light are both alike to thee,</hi> Pſal. 139.11, 12. <hi>If we have forgotten the Name of our God, or ſtretched out our hands to a ſtrange God: Shall not God ſearch it out? for he knoweth the ſecrets of the heart,</hi> Pſal. 44.20, 21. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhewed his ſincerity, and the uprightneſs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52962:29"/> of his heart in this, that though none was in the houſe when his Miſtris tempted him to follie, yet he would not hearken to her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that in Levit. 19.14. is very remarkable to this purpoſe; <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe the deaf, nor put a ſtumbling block before the blinde, but ſhalt fear thy God.</hi> If one ſhould curſe the deaf, he needeth not to feare the deaf, becauſe he cannot heare him. And ſo if one ſhould put a ſtumbling block before the blinde, he needeth not to feare the blinde, becauſe he cannot ſee him. But he that feares God, will neither doe the one nor the other, becauſe God is neither blinde nor deafe, but ſees and heares whatſoever is done, whatſoever is ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only when God doth cauſe his face to ſhine upon us, and makes us to thrive and proſper in the world, but alſo when he doth hide his face from us, and ſends trouble and affliction upon us. Therefore afflictions are called in Scripture, temptations, and trials, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are tried whether we be ſincere and upright or no. <hi>Now for a ſeaſon (if need be) you are in heavineſs through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold temptations; That the triall of your faith, being much more pretious then of gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praiſe, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. <hi>Beloved, thinke it not ſtrange concerning the fiery triall, which is to try you,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12. <hi>Behold, the divel ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon, that ye may be tried, and ye ſhall have tribulation ten dayes,</hi> Revel. 2.10. <hi>Thou, O God, hast proved us, thou haſt tried us as ſilver is tried.</hi> (How?) <hi>Thou broughteſt us into the net, thou laidſt affliction upon our loines: Thou haſt cauſed men to ride over our heads,</hi> Pſal. 66.10, 11, 12. <hi>Iob's</hi> integritie and uprightneſs was tried by this, that although the devil ſlandered him, ſaying, <hi>Doth Job ſerve God for nought? Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubſtance is encreaſed in the land. But put forth thine hand, and touch all that he hath,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52962:29"/> and he will curſe thee to thy face,</hi> Job 1.9, 10, 11. And againe, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face,</hi> Job 2.4, 5. Yet <hi>Job</hi> in his greateſt adverſitie did keepe cloſe unto God, and did not turne from him; this ſhewed him to be indeed <hi>a perfect</hi> (that is, ſincere) <hi>and upright man,</hi> as he is ſtiled, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.1, 8. and 2.3. So the people of God proove their ſinceritie by this, that notwithſtanding all their afflictions, which they endured, yet they did not fall off from following the Lord, as hypocrites in ſuch a caſe uſe to doe. <hi>All this is come upon us,</hi> (ſay they, meaning all the affliction before mentioned from verſ. 9. to v. 16.) <hi>yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy covenant: Our heart is not turned backe neither have our ſteps declined from thy way. Though thou haſt ſore bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death,</hi> Pſal. 44.17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not only while the affliction is upon us,<note place="margin">O utinam ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſemper eſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſani, quales nos futuros pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitemur aegroti, <hi>Plin. Epiſt.</hi>
                  </note> but alſo when it is remooved, and we are delivered out of it. Some, like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when the afflicting hand of God is upon them, will promiſe and profeſſe much reformation; but deliverance being obtained, they performe no ſuch matter; when God doth once remove his ſtroke from them, preſently they fall to their former practices, and ſhew themſelves as vile and lewd as every they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The hollow-heartedneſs of the Iſraelites is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by this, <hi>When God ſlew them</hi> (ſent deſtroying judgments among them) <hi>then they ſought him, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and enquired early after God: And they remembred, that God was their rocke, and the high God their Redeemer. Nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouthes, and lie unto him with their tongues: Their hearts were not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78.34, 35, 36, 37. <hi>David</hi> ſheweth his uprightneſs by this, that when he was delivered out of trouble, he was carefull to performe what he had promiſed when he was in trouble.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52962:30"/> 
                  <hi>I will goe into thine houſe</hi> (ſo ſaith he unto God) <hi>with burnt-offerings, and will pay thee my vowes, which my lipps have uttered, and my mouth hath ſpoken when I was in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Pſal. 66.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we be upright, we will be willing to be plainly dealt with, and to have the word brought home to our conſciences, and particularly applied unto us. <hi>Doe not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi> ſaith God, Mic. 2.7. When the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> dealt roundly with <hi>David,</hi> telling him plainly that he was the man, to wit, that had ſinned grievouſly, and did aggravate his ſins againſt him; <hi>David</hi> humbly cried <hi>peccavi,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7, — 13. Neither did he love <hi>Nathan</hi> a whit the leſſe for being ſo plaine with him, but did highly honour him even to his dying day, as appeares by the hiſtorie, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.24,—27. So when the prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> had ſharpely reproved, and ſeverely threatned <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> for that wherein he was faultie, <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> anſwered, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord, which thou haſt ſpoken;</hi> Iſa. 39.8. Thus alſo <hi>Eli,</hi> when he percieved that the Lord had ſpoken concerning him unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> though <hi>Samuel</hi> was but a child, yet he diſdained not to heare him; yea though he knew it was a very harſh meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which <hi>Samuel</hi> had to deliver unto him, and ſaw that <hi>Samuel</hi> was afraid to deliver it, yet he ſtraitly charged him to doe it: and when he heard it, he meekly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto it, ſaying, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.16, 17, 18. But on the other ſide, when <hi>Amaziah</hi> was reprooved by the prophet for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the gods of <hi>Edom,</hi> he ſcorned the reproof, and taunted the reproover, ſaying, <hi>Art thou made of the kings counſell?</hi> and then he alſo threatned him, ſaying, <hi>Forbeare, why ſhouldeſt thou be ſmitten?</hi> 2 Chron. 25.15, 16. This did manifeſt him to be unſound, as it is ſaid of him, v. 2. <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</hi> So the leaven of the Phariſees, even their hypocriſie, appeared in this, that when they heard
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52962:30"/> our Saviour ſpeake againſt covetouſneſs, <hi>they being covetous derided him,</hi> Luke 16.14, 15. And marke this, it is a ſigne of an upright heart, to confeſſe what we are guiltie of, not only to God, but alſo to men, when they charge us with it, and reproove us for it. So <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.13. and <hi>Jonah</hi> to the mariners, Jon. 1.10. See alſo Joſh. 7.19.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we be upright, we will be more ready to judge and cenſure our ſelves then others. Our Saviour makes it the property of an hypocrite, to behold a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in his brothers eye, and not to conſider a beame in his owne eye, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.3. To admoniſh and reproove others, is not a fault, yea it is a dutie, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. But to tell others of their faults, and not to minde our owne; to reproove others, and nor to reforme our ſelves, this ſavours ſtrongly of hypocriſie. Therefore, that man after Gods heart, <hi>David,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet into thy teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.59.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we be upright, we will he humble. Pride argues hypocriſie; <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet Habakkuk) <hi>his ſoule, that is lifted up, is not upright in him,</hi> Hab. 2.4. He that is upright, ſeekes the glorie of God, ſee <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.18. but he that is proud, feeketh his own glorie: therefore pride and uprightneſs are inconſiſtent, and cannot ſtand together.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we be upright, then Jeſus Chriſt doth dwell in our hearts by faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. For it is faith (faith in the Lord Jeſus) by which our hearts are purified, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. A heart of unbeliefe is an evill heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12.</p>
               <p>I ſhall make but one uſe more of the point, and that is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> for Exhortation. Let us therefore have a care to walke uprightly: if we faſt, pray, give almes, what ever we doe, let us be ſure that our hearts be upright in it. To incite us the more hereunto let us conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if the heart be upright,<note place="margin">Motives to perſwade unto uprightneſs.</note> God will accept of weake ſervice, pardoning our failings, and paſſing by our imperfections. <hi>I will ſpare them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as a man ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52962:31"/> his ſon that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3.17. A man will not be over-rigid and ſevere with his ſon that ſerveth him, but will ſpare him, knowing that though he doth things weakely, yet he doth them ſincerely, that his deſire is to pleaſe his father, whom he ſerveth: even ſo will God be indulgent and favorable to thoſe, whoſe hearts he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be upright with him. God will <hi>pardon every one, that prepareth his heart to ſeeke him, though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the ſanctuary,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.18, 19. <hi>Aſa</hi> had divers failings, as we reade 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. and 16. yet God ſpared him, and accepted the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and uprightneſs of his heart. <hi>The high places were not taken away out of Iſrael, nevertheleſs the heart of Aſa was perfect all his dayes,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.17. On the otherſide, the moſt glorious ſervice is of no worth, if the heart be not upright in it. This marr'd all that <hi>Amaziah</hi> did, <hi>he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 25.2. God cannot endure thoſe that draw neare him with their mouth, and honour him with their lips, but remoove their hearts farre from him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.13. Hollow-hearted performances may procure ſome outward, temporal reward, for the encouragement of others; thus God rewarded <hi>Iehu</hi> for what he did, though his heart was not ſincere, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.30, 31. But <hi>the reward of the inheritance</hi> (as the Apoſtle calles it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.24.) ſuch ſervices ſhall not procure. Yea, though <hi>Iehu's</hi> ſervice in one reſpect was rewarded, to wit, as the thing done, the judgment executed upon <hi>Ahab</hi> and his familie was pleaſing unto God; yet it was puniſhed, and accounted as murther, in that he was not upright in that which he did; he ſought indeed his owne ends, and not the glorie of God in it. <hi>Yet a little while</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and I will avenge the blood of Iezreel</hi> (that is) of <hi>Ahab</hi> and his familie, ſlaine in Jezreel, <hi>upon the houſe of Iehu</hi> &amp;c. Hoſ. 1.4. But if the ſervice proceed from a heart groſly hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, purpoſely making a ſhew of that which it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, it is much more odious and abominable in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52962:31"/> ſight of God. <hi>Ye are they</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to the Phariſees) <hi>that juſtifie your ſelves before men, but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly eſteemed among men, is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the ſight of God,</hi> Luke 16.15. And againe, <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites;</hi>

                  <hi>for ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour widdowes houſes, and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore ye ſhall receive the greater damnation,</hi> Mat. 23.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upright walking is that, which will make us walke with comfort and confidence. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely: but he that perverteth his wayes, ſhall be known,</hi> Prov. 10.9. <hi>Whoſo walketh uprightly, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but he that is perverſe in his wayes, ſhall fall at once,</hi> Prov. 28.18. <hi>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them,</hi> (or, as the margent hath it,) <hi>ſtrongly to hold with them) whoſe heart is perfect towards him,</hi> 2 Chron. 16.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This will afford comfort and courage in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. <hi>If our heart condemne us not, then have we bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards God: And whatſoever we aske, we receive of him,</hi> &amp;c. to wit, ſo farre as he ſees it to be for his glory and our good, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimonie of our conſcience, that in all ſimplicitie and godly ſinceritie, not with fleſhly wiſdome, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. This was it, that did ſupport and uphold <hi>Iob</hi> in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſtreſſe. <hi>Though</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him: but I will maintaine mine owne waies before him,</hi> (He meanes the integrity and uprightneſs of his heart in his waies.) <hi>He alſo ſhall be my ſalvation; for an hypocrite ſhall not come before him,</hi> Job 13.15, 16. And againe, <hi>But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth as gold,</hi> Job 23.10. The whole 31. Chapter is alſo to this purpoſe. On the otherſide, when affliction and diſtreſſe cometh, then <hi>the ſinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs doth ſurprize the hypocrites,</hi> Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Will God heare his crie</hi> (ſaith Job, ſpeaking of an hypocrite) <hi>when trouble cometh upon him?</hi> Job 27.9. No, <hi>If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52962:32"/> inquitie in mine heart,</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>the Lord will not heare me,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked</hi> (ſaith Salomon) <hi>is an abomination to the Lord; but the prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Prov. 15.8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we walke uprightly, we neede not feare when death cometh, but may have boldneſs at the approach of it. When <hi>Ezekiah</hi> was told by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> that he ſhould ſet his houſe in order, for he ſhould not live, but die, though in ſome reſpects he was deſirous to live ſtill, yet this did comfort and encourage him, that he could ſay, <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight,</hi> Iſa. 38.3. But (ſaith Job) <hi>What is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God ſhall take away his ſoule?</hi> Job 27.8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, If we walke uprightly, that great day, the day of judgment, which will be a day of terrour and confuſion unto all the ungodly, will be unto us a day of triumph and rejoycing. <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of judgment, becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world,</hi> 1 John 3.17. When that day cometh, Then <hi>the Lord will bring to light the hidded things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſel of the hearts: and then ſhall every man</hi> (to wit, that walketh uprightly) <hi>have praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5. In this reſpect our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bids, <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Phariſees, which is hypocriſy;</hi> becauſe the day will come that will reveal all, and make all manifeſt. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is nothing covered, that ſhall not be revealed; neither hid, that ſhall not be known,</hi> Luke 12.1, 2. Thus then in many reſpects we may ſee that there is great cauſe to pray with David, <hi>Let mine heart (O Lord) be ſound in thy ſtatutes, that I may not be aſhamed,</hi> Pſal. 119.80.</p>

But you have not ſo learned Chriſt: If ſo be ye have been taught by him, as the truth is in Ieſus: That ye put off (as concerning the former converſation) the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts: And be renewed in the ſpirit of your minde: And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.19, — 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This doctrine ſerves to convince all ſuch as looke <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> for ſalvation, and yet heed not to worke righteouſneſs. Though whiles they live, they worke iniquity and live
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52962:34"/> wickedly, yet when they die they thinke to be ſaved as others. But this is a moſt vaine and fooliſh, a moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational and abſurd imagination; as if one ſhould ſow tares, and hope to reape wheat. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked; as a man ſoweth, ſo ſhall he reape. For he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption: but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reape life everlasting,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8. It was truly ſaid by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> though not rightly applied to <hi>Job,</hi> whom he falſly judged wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that affliction which he was in; <hi>They that plow iniquity, and ſow wickedneſs, reape the ſame,</hi> Job 4.8. It is worthy to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this point, to wit, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God, nor enjoy ſalvation, he divers times admoniſheth Chriſtians to take heed of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. This inculcating of our admonition, ſhewes both that it is a dangerous thing to be deceived in this caſe, which all will (I preſume) eaſily grant; and alſo that people herein are very apt to be deceived. And ſo experience ſhewes, that in this great and weighty buſineſs people many ways deceive themſelves, building caſtles (as they ſay) in the aire, and promiſing unto themſelves ſalvation and eternal life, though they regard nothing leſſe then to performe this, which is required of all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, to wit, to worke righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some preſume upon this, that God is merciful. But though Gods mercy be never ſo great, as it is infinite and incomprehenſible, yet it nothing at all belongs unto them that worke wickedneſs, I meane, that continue in that courſe, and will not turne from it. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet Eſay) <hi>and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man his thoughts, and turne unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God: for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſai. 55.7. <hi>David</hi> extolled Gods mercy as much as may be; yet ever ſheweth to whom it doth belong, namely, to them that feare him, and ſo he excludes the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52962:34"/> wicked and unrighteous from having any ſhare in it. <hi>As the heaven is high above the earth,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo great is his mercy</hi> (towards whom?) <hi>towards them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 103.11. And verſ. 13. <hi>Like as a father pitieth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſo the Lord pitieth</hi> (whom?) <hi>them that feare him.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon</hi> (whom?) <hi>them that feare him, and his righteouſneſs to childrens children, To ſuch as keepe his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and thinke upon his commandments to doe them.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Chriſt (ſay ſome) died for us; therefore they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that howſoever they live, yet through Chriſt they ſhall be ſaved. But Chriſt died for our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as well as for our ſalvation. <hi>He loved the Church, and gave himſelfe for it, That he might ſanctifie it,</hi> Epheſ. 5.25, 26. <hi>He gave himſelfe for us, to redeeme us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people, zealous of good workes,</hi> Tit. 2.14. None ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, but ſuch as are ſanctified by him. As for thoſe that worke iniquity, he will ſay unto them, <hi>Depart from me, I know ye not,</hi> Matth. 7.23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some flatter themſelves as if their ſinnes were only ſinnes of infirmity, and therefore ſhould not prejudice their ſalvation. But if they did ſin of infirmity, 1. They would not make a common practice of ſin, as they doe. It is the propertie of the wicked, <hi>to ſet himſelfe in a way that is not good,</hi> Pſal. 36.4. <hi>Noah, Lot, David,</hi> and other godly men, through infirmity fell into ſin, groſſe and hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſin, but they did not make it their practiſe. No, thus the godly <hi>doe none iniquity,</hi> that is, they doe not give themſelves up to the practice if any iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.3. <hi>they walke in Gods wayes,</hi> as there it followes immediately after. 2. Their ſinnes would be more troubleſome and grievous unto them, then they are. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head, and are a heavy burthen, too heavy for me to beare,</hi> Pſal. 38.4. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Thus did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> complaine, which ſhewes that their ſinnes were
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52962:35"/> indeed of infirmity: but ſo are not theirs, <hi>who rejoyce to doe evil,</hi> Prov. 2.14. <hi>Who make a mocke of ſin,</hi> Prov. 14.9. Such as theſe doe not ſin of infirmity, but of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some build upon this, that they performe holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; they heare, pray, &amp;c. But, <hi>the ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.8. to wit, becauſe as it followes verſ. 9. <hi>The way of the wicked is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver; and he ſhall purifie the ſonnes of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſneſs. Then ſhall the offerings of Judah and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem be pleaſant unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Mal. 3.3, 4. <hi>Then,</hi> that is, when they that offer them, are made pure. <hi>If a man therefore purge himſelfe from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſanctified, and meet for the maſters uſe, and prepared unto every good worke,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.21. A man of any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity cannot endure to be ſerved in an uncleane veſſel, ſo much leſſe can God endure that ſervice, which proceeds from the wicked and ungodly. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.11, — 17. and 66.3. This <hi>David</hi> conſidered, and therefore he ſaid, <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocency, and ſo will I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe thine altar, O Lord,</hi> Pſal. 26.6.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and other ſuch like grounds many have to build their hopes of heaven and heavenly happineſs upon; but they are falſe grounds, and will deceive them; falſe, I ſay, either ſimply in themſelves, or at leaſt as they build upon them.</p>
               <p>Let us then be provoked and ſtirred up to worke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Let us conſider,</p>

That this is pleaſing unto God; <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 11.7. And becauſe he loveth it, therefore alſo we ſhall love and practice it. <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evil,</hi> Pſal. 97.10. <hi>Hate the evill, and love the good,</hi> Amos 5.15. <hi>Abhorre that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good,</hi> Rom. 12.9.</p>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52962:35"/>2. That this is profitable to our ſelves. Indeed God loves righteouſneſs, and hates iniquity; but our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs cannot profit him, nor our iniquity doe him any prejudice. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doest thou againſt him? or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doeſt thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedneſs may hurt a man, as thou art, and thy righteouſneſs may profit the ſon of man,</hi> Job 35.6, 7, 8. But God can neither be hurt by the one, nor profited by the other. Now if we be righteous we our ſelves ſhall have the benefit of it; if we be unrighteous, we our ſelves ſhall ſuffer for it. <hi>If thou beeſt wiſe,</hi> (ſaith Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) <hi>thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelfe; but if thou ſcorneſt, thou alone ſhall beare it,</hi> Prov. 9.12. Let us take heede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of being like <hi>Balaam, who loved the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.15. Yet he could ſay, <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his,</hi> Num. 23.10. Let us live the life of the righteous, if we would die the death of the righteous: let us worke the workes of righteouſneſs, if we would obtaine <hi>the crowne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>

Yea if we would enjoy the good things of this live, let us have a care to worke righteouſneſs. <hi>For godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſe both of the life that now is, and alſo of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. <hi>Firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe</hi> (outward and earthly) <hi>things ſhall be added unto you,</hi> ſo farre forth as God ſees them needful and expedient for you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. Whether the righteous have little or much of theſe outward things, they have Gods bleſſing with it, which is more then all beſides; and without which all is nothing. This, the wicked want whatſoever they have beſides; though the things, which they have, in themſelves conſidered, be bleſſings, yet to them they are not bleſſings, but curſes. <hi>Becauſe they doe not give glorie unto the name of God, therefore he doth curſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52962:36"/> their bleſſings,</hi> Mal. 2.2. <hi>Their proſperity doth destroy them,</hi> Prov. 1.32. <hi>Their table is made a ſnare unto them, and that which ſhould have been for their welfare, is unto them an occaſion of ruine,</hi> Pſal. 69.22. <hi>The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the juſt,</hi> Prov. 3.33.

So Revel. 22.15. among thoſe that ſhall be without, that ſhall have no place in the heavenly Jeruſalem, is reckoned <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loveth, and maketh a lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the further confirmation of the doctrine, there are theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Lying is repugnant unto God, and odious unto him. For God is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>the God of truth,</hi> Iſai. 65.15. Amongſt thoſe things, that are an abomination unto God, is reckoned <hi>a lying tongue,</hi> Prov. 6.16, 17. So Prov. 12.22. <hi>Lyings lipps are an abomination to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Lying is a part of the old man, which al muſt put off, that would be ſaved. The Apoſtle having ſhewed, that ſuch as have truely learned Chriſt, have learned this, that they muſt <hi>put off concerning the former converſation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts; And be renewed in the ſpirit of their minde; And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs;</hi> from thence he inferres this exhorta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>on, <hi>Wherefore putting away lying, ſpeake the truth every man with his neighbour,</hi> Epheſ. 4.20, — 25. So Col. 3.9. <hi>Lie not one to another,</hi> (ſaith he; why?) <hi>ſeeing that ye have put off the old man with his deedes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Lying is the worke and invention of the devil. <hi>He abode not in the truth,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, ſpeaking of the devil) <hi>becauſe there is no truth in him: when he ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his owne; for he is a lyar, and the father of it,</hi> to wit, of a lie, John 8.44.</p>
               <p>Before I come to the uſe of the point, ſome things
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52962:39"/> are to be obſerved for the better underſtanding of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not allways neceſſary, nor expedient to ſpeake all that we know, or thinke of a thing, whereof we ſpeake. <hi>A foole uttereth all his minde; but a wiſe man keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in till afterwards,</hi> till occaſion require him to ſpeak, Prov. 29.11. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time, and judgment,</hi> both when, and how to ſpeake, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.5. But it is both expedient and neceſſary; that we ſpeake no more then we know, or thinke; for this is lying, though the other be not. It is lawful and requiſite ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to conceale what is true; but it is never either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, or lawful to utter what is falſe; the former is no lying, but the latter is. <hi>Abraham</hi> might be too blame in ſaying of <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife, <hi>She is my ſiſter,</hi> Gen. 20.2. In this he might ſhew his weakneſs of faith, and might expoſe his wives chaſtity to danger; but I doe not well ſee how he can juſtly be taxed for lying, becauſe there was nothing falſe that he uttered, though there were ſome thing true which he concealed. For <hi>Sarah,</hi> as ſhe was his wife, ſo was ſhe alſo his ſiſter, that is, his neare kinſwoman, which in the Hebrew language is as much as ſiſter.<note place="margin">The Jewiſh Doctors thinke <hi>Iſcah,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Haran, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> brother, to be the ſame with <hi>Sarah.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Annotatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes meas in Gen. 11.29.</note> When <hi>Abimelech</hi> underſtood that <hi>Sarah</hi> was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> wife, and expoſtulated with <hi>Abraham</hi> about it; <hi>Abraham</hi> having ſhewed the reaſon why he ſaid that ſhe was his ſiſter, and concealed that ſhe was his wife, added, <hi>And yet indeed ſhe is my ſiſter; ſhe is the daughter of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not the daughter of my mother,</hi> (he meanes, that ſhe was his kinſwoman by his father, but not by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>and ſhe became my wife,</hi> Gen. 20.12.</p>

The Prophet meant, that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould not go up; for that if he did, he ſhould not proſper, as a little after he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him. And <hi>Ahab</hi> (it ſeemes) perceived, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> did not ſpeake ſeriouſly, or at leaſt ſuſpected ſo much, and therefore he ſaid unto him (verſ. 16.) <hi>How many times ſhall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord?</hi> But ſuch ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are no lies, becauſe the geſture and pronuntiation of him that ſpeaketh, doe ſhew that he intends the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he ſpeaketh.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> And firſt, it ſpeakes reproofe and terrour to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who regard not to ſpeake the truth, and to refraine from lying.

               <p>But that every one may the better perceive how farr forth he is guiltie, I will ſpeake more diſtinctly of the ſeveral kindes of lying.<note place="margin">Mendacium eſt triplex; Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſum, jocoſum, officioſum.</note> The moſt uſual and received di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of lies, is that of the Schoolmen, who diſtinguiſh a lie into <hi>pernicious, ſportful,</hi> and <hi>officious.</hi> Firſt there is a pernitious lie, when a man by lying is prejudicial and hurtful to another. Now there are many kindes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious liars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The covetous coſening liar, who by lying, cheates and defraudes him, with whom he dealeth, and makes a prey of him. Such a liar was <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>n after <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, and by forging a lie got great gifts of him, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5.22, 23. This kinde of lying is moſt riſe and common among people in buying, ſelling and bargaining. <hi>It is naught, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is naught, ſaith the buyer: but when he is gone, he boaſteth,</hi> Prov. 20.14. So on the other ſide the ſeller will be as ready to ſay, <hi>It is good, it is good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Laudat vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, qui vult ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudere merces.</note> when he knoweth that it is not good, or not ſo good as he would make it. It is an ordinary thing with ſome to ſay, and ſweare too, it may be, that a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie coſt them ſo much, and they were offered ſo much for it, and the like, when indeed no ſuch matter. What faire, market, ſhop, houſe, or place almoſt can one come into, but this kinde of lying is to be found in it? In reſpect of this one kinde of lying we may take up the words of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Who can finde a faithful man?</hi> Prov. 20.6. But whoſoever uſe this kinde of lying, let them conſider what the ſame wiſe man ſaith; <hi>The getting of treaſures by a lying tongue, is a vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeeke death,</hi> Prov. 21.6.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52962:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> that uſe it, doe but <hi>ſeeke death</hi> and deſtruction by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The falſe witneſs-bearing lyar. How pernitious a lyar this is, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhewes, ſaying, <hi>A man that beareth falſe witneſs againſt his neighbour, is a maule, and a ſword, and a ſharpe arrow,</hi> Prov. 25.18. When a man being called to give evidence in a matter, ſpeakes, yea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the very letter of the commandment runnes thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſs againſt thy neighbour,</hi> Exod. 20.16. So Exod. 23.1. <hi>Put not thine hand</hi> (joyne not) <hi>with the wicked to be an unrighteous witneſs.</hi> No, take heede of it; for <hi>though hand joyne in hand, yet the wicked ſhall not be unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,</hi> Proverb. 11.22.

               <p n="3">3. The railing and reviling liar, that openly ſpeaketh all manner of evil of another falſly. Thus ſome, when they fall out, with open mouth revile one another, and ſpeake one of another they care not what. This kinde of lying, drunkards are more eſpecially ſubject to; and therefore not without cauſe, <hi>rayler and drunkard</hi> are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.

                  </gap> wit, perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious lying, and of many kindes of that lying.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next kinde of lying is ſportful lying, when a man by lying intends no michiefe or hurt to any, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeekes to make himſelf and others merry. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to his head <hi>Ioſephs</hi> dealing with <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note> when he cauſed the cup to be put into his ſacke, pretending as if <hi>Benjamin</hi> had ſtolne it. But <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did not this for ſport, but with a ſerious intent, to try his brethren how they ſtood affected towards <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and what care they had of their father, who (he knew) loved <hi>Benjamin</hi> moſt dearly, to ſee if they did not therefore envy and hate <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> as for the ſame cauſe they had envied and hated <hi>Ioſeph</hi> himſelfe: So that if that carriage of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> towards <hi>Benjamin</hi> were lying, (which I ſee no neceſſity to affirme) it was rather officious then ſportful lying. However, this kinde of lying in ſport is ſuch as cannot be defended. For, if for every idle word that men ſhall ſpeake, they muſt give an account in the day of judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. then ſurely much more for every falſe and lying word. And if fooliſh talking and jeſting be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.4. then ſurely much more lying talking, and ſuch jeſting as hath lying mixed with it.</p>
               <p>Now of ſuch liars there are eſpecially two ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſtorie-telling liar, one that for ſport-ſake doth tell falſe and fabulous ſtories. Who are moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faulty in this kinde, the very terme doth ſhew, which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52962:43"/> is uſually given to ſuch ſtories; for they are called <hi>old wives tales,</hi> or <hi>old wives fables,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.7. Travellers alſo are commonly noted for this kinde of lying; they having been in remote countries, will tell ſtrange ſtories, mixing truth and falſhood together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The news-telling liar, one that is of the <hi>Athenian</hi> humour delighting <hi>to tell, or heare ſome new thing,</hi> Act. 17.21. Such will uſually coyne news, if they have none that is true, and, or if they have, yet they will adde unto it, and make it more then it is. Fame (as the Poet ſaith) <hi>creſcit eundo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap> growes as it goes: it is like a ſnow-ball, the further it goes, the bigger it growes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt kinde of lying is officious lying, when a man tels a lye for ſome good end, as to helpe himſelfe or others in a time of need, or to prevent ſome danger that is likely to enſue. This kinde of lying hath a faire pretence, yet is it not therefore lawful. For though it be for never ſo good an end, yet it is not lawful to lie. <hi>Will ye ſpeake wickedly for God, and talke deceitfully for him?</hi> ſaid <hi>Iob</hi> to his friends, <hi>Iob</hi> 13.7. We muſt not doe evil that good may come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. Good ends muſt be attained unto by good means, and good cauſes muſt be handled in a good manner.<note place="margin">Bonum ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ex integrâ cauſâ, malum ex quolibet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu.</note> If the end be evil, it is enough to make the action, though otherwiſe good, to be evil: but if the end be good, it is not enough to make the action good, if otherwiſe it be evil.</p>
               <p>Some may object, that <hi>David</hi> for his own ſafety told a lie to <hi>Abimelech,</hi>

                  </gap>ing fled for fear of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> marvelling to ſee him come in that manner without attendants, he told him, that <hi>Saul</hi> had ſent about ſome urgent occaſion in ſuch haſt, that he had not time to accommodate himſelfe as otherwiſe he ſhould have done, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. And that the Midwives lied unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he being wroth with them for ſaving the children of the Hebrewes, whom he commanded them to deſtroy, they ſaid that the Hebrew woman were not like thoſe of Egypt, but were more lively, and were delivered before
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52962:43"/> that the midwives came unto them. So likewiſe that <hi>Rahab</hi> lied, when the king of Jericho, ſending unto her about the ſpies, which ſhe had entertained, and hid, ſhe ſaid that ſuch men indeed came to her, but were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and gone ſhe knew not whither, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 2.</p>

                  </label> Suppoſe that all theſe did lie, as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>David</hi> did, and ſo moſt probable that the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives and <hi>Rahab</hi> did alſo, though ſome indeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, yet it doth not follow that lying in ſuch caſes is lawful. We muſt walke by precepts and not by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; we muſt not ſo follow examples, as to ſwerve from precepts. Good men, and good women, are but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, and therefore they are not ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be followed, but only ſo farre forth as they are good,<note place="margin">Haec quando in Scripturis Sanctis legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, non ideo quia facta cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus, etiam facienda cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus, ne vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, dum paſſim ſectamur ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla. <hi>Aug. contra Mend. cap.</hi> 9.</note> and that is ſo farre forth as they walke according to the rule, which God hath preſcribed to walke by. <hi>Be ye followers of me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, not abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, but <hi>as I am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt is to be propounded as exemplary in all things, (I meane things that concerne us to practize) becauſe <hi>he did no ſin,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22. As for others, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe never ſo good, they are not to be ſet before us as abſolute patternes for our imitation; becauſe the beſt have had, and will have their failings: <hi>in many things</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iames) we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3.2. It is true, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> eating of the ſhewbread, which <hi>Abimelech</hi> gave him, is excuſed and juſtified by our Saviour, becauſe it was in a caſe of neceſſity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.3, 4. But his lying, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he obtained that ſhewbread, is not juſtified. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can this be excuſed by reaſon of neceſſity; for this is a thing ſimply and abſolutely evil, which to eat the ſhewbread was not; and therefore this might not be done in any caſe, as in ſome caſe the other might. So God bleſſed the midwives for that they feared him more then man, and would not obey the king in deſtroying the infants, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17, 20. <hi>Rahab</hi> alſo is commended for her faith, in that ſhe received the ſpies, and ſent them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52962:44"/> away in peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.25. But neither is ſhe commended, neither were the other bleſſed for lying. This was their weakneſs, which God was pleaſed to pardon, but we may not preſume to imitate. We muſt <hi>follow, not that which is evill, but that which is good,</hi> 3 Joh. 11. If becauſe of thoſe, or other the like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we ſhould make bold to lye, as they did, that which was but a ſin of infirmity in them, would be a ſin of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in us, and ſo we ſhould not be ſo capable of mercy as they were whom we think to imitate. <hi>Keep backe thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſinns,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> unto God) <hi>let them not have dominion over me; Then ſhall I be upright, and I ſhall be innocent from the great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> Pſal. 19.13.</p>
               <p>Thus then all lying, even the beſt kinde of lying, is evil and unlawful.</p>

                  </gap>n, that is, lie with a liar; and <hi>Fallere fallentem non eſt fraus,</hi> To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a deceiver is no deceit; theſe proverbs, I ſay, are none of thoſe, which the Spirit of God teacheth; but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52962:44"/> they have proceeded from that lying ſpirit, the divel. Some may think it a high point of wiſdome to circumvent thoſe that would circumvent them, yet S. <hi>Iames</hi> bids, <hi>Lie not againſt the truth.</hi> And immediately he adds; <hi>This wiſdome deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh,</hi> Jam. 3.14, 15. Our Saviour alſo bids, <hi>Be wiſe as ſerpents,</hi> but ſo withal he adds, <hi>and innocent as doves,</hi> Matth. 10.16. So the Apoſtle, <hi>I would have you wiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto that which is good, and ſimple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning evil,</hi> R m 16.19. And he bids, <hi>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good,</hi> Rom. 12.21.</p>
               <p>But ſome there are, who are aſhamed to plead for lying, under the name of lying; yet under ſome other name they will plead for it, as under the name of an excuſe, or of equivocation and mental reſervation. Some will ſay, They hope they may make an excuſe for themſelves or others, if need be. But if they know the excuſe to be falſe, it is a lie, and they may not make it; if they doe, neither they, nor their excuſe can be excuſed. If thy cauſe be good, doe not make it bad by maintaining it ill: if it be bad, doe not make it worſe by maintaining it at all, and eſpecially by lying.</p>
               <p>But the Jeſuites are moſt groſſe this way, who have ſet forth bookes in defence of that which is indeed lying, though they will not have it called or accounted ſo, but equivocation and mental reſervation. Suppoſe a Romiſh Prieſt be examined by a Magiſtrate whether he be a Prieſt or no; they teach and maintaine that he may lawfully ſay, yea and ſweare too that he is no Prieſt, meaning, of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or the like; or no ſuch Prieſt as the Magiſtrate deſires; or not ſo as to tell him. But by this device <hi>Peter</hi> might well and truely have denied Chriſt, ſaying and ſwearing that he knew him not, to wit, to be ſuch an one as they tooke him to be, or to tell them, and the like. Neither is there any truth ſo plaine and manifeſt, but a man by this reaſon may denie it without lying. But ſuch fig-leaves are not ſufficient to cover the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52962:45"/> ſhame of ſuch lying. The patrons and defenders of it, little heed that of the Apoſtle: <hi>Wee have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſs, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, commending our ſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4 2.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> 2. Therefore let us have a care when we doe ſpeake, to ſpeake the truth, and to eſchew lying. To this end let us conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our profeſſion doth require this of us. For we profeſſe that we beleeve in God, and in Jeſus Chriſt, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and that we embrace the Goſpel. Now God is <hi>the God of truth,</hi> Iſai. 65.16. He is one <hi>that cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1.2. And Chriſt is <hi>the truth,</hi> John. 14.6. He is <hi>the Amen, the faithful and true witneſs,</hi> Revel. 3.14. <hi>There was no guile in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2, 22, The Holy Ghoſt alſo is <hi>the ſpirit of truth,</hi> John 15.26. and 16.13. And the Goſpel is <hi>the word of truth,</hi> Jam. 1.18. and <hi>the way of truth,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lying perverts and overthrowes the nature of ſpeech. For ſpeech is ordained for that end, that we may make known our mindes one to another: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we uſe lying, if we ſpeake one thing, and thinke another, we abuſe that faculty of ſpeech, which God hath given us, and make it ſerve to a quite contrary end then that for which God hath ordained it. Let not any ſay or thinke ſo proudly and preſumptuouſly, as <hi>David</hi> ſhewes ſome do; ſaying, <hi>With our tongues will we prevaile, our lips are our owne; who is Lord over us?</hi> Pſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 12.4. No, God is Lord over us, our lips are not our owne, he hath made them, and not we our ſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt uſe them, not as we our ſelves thinke meet, but as he doth require of us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lying deſtroyes all ſociety among men. Man (as the Philoſopher obſerveth) is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a ſociable creature,</hi> now ſpeech is a means whereby men have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety one with another. When the language of men
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52962:45"/> was confounded, ſo that one could not tell what another ſpake, then preſently their combination was diſſolved,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> they were forced to deſiſt from their enterprize, and to give it over. When one asked bricke,<note place="margin">R. Sal. on Gen. 11.</note> (ſaith a Rabin) another brought clay, and then they fell together by the eares, and one daſhed out the others braines. This is more then the Scripture records; but ſo much it ſhewes, that their confederacie and aſpiration was ſoon broken; when once, by reaſon of the confuſion of tongues, they could not make known their mindes one to another. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith truely, <hi>Diverſity of tongues doth alienate and estrange one man from another, ſo that a man had rather be with his dog then with one of a ſtrange and unknown lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But ſurely a lying tongue is a far worſe enemy to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety then an unknown tongue; and much better it is for a man to have no ſociety at all, then with ſuch as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve what they ſay; or if he doe, he ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them. Concerning ſuch we may well take up the words of Jacob, <hi>O my ſoule, come not thou into their ſecret; unto their aſſembly, mine honour, be not thou united,</hi> Gen. 49.6. <hi>I have not ſate with vaine perſons,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) neither will I goe in with diſſemblers,</hi> Pſal. 26.4. <hi>Deliver my ſoule, O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue,</hi> Pſal. 120.2. And preſently after he cryes out, <hi>Woe is me that I ſojourne in Meſhec, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>O that I had in the wilderneſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremie) a lodging place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them:</hi> (why ſo?) <hi>for they be all adulterers, an aſſembly of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous men. And they bend their tongues like their bowe for lies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and truſt ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly ſupplant, and every neighbour will walk with ſlander. And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not ſpeake the truth; they have taught their tongues to ſpeake lies, and weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to commit iniquity,</hi> Jer. 9.2, — 5. Better it were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52962:46"/> to live in the wilderneſs then with ſuch as theſe; better to be alone, then to have ſuch ſociety.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fruit of truth is permanent and laſthing, but the fruit of lying is tranſient and fading. <hi>The lip of truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever, but a lying tongue is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Prov. 12.19.

               <p>THis is the ſecond particular note, whereby he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed who ſhall abide in Gods tabernacle, and dwell in his holy hill. <hi>He that backbiteth not,</hi> &amp;c.] To backbite (as the word it ſelf doth ſhew) is to ſpeake evil of one behinde his backe, to wit, when there is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52962:46"/> no juſt occaſion for it. As, 1. To denie that good to be in one, which is in him. 2. To extenuate the good which is in one, to make it leſſe then it is. 3. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave that good which is in one, as to ſay that he doth good with an evil intent, for an evil end. 4. To charge one with that evil, which he is not guiltie of. 5. To aggravate the evil which one is guilty of, and to make it worſe then it is. 6. To reveale ones ſecret faults, or to ſpeake of them unſeaſonably, when no juſt occaſion doth require it. For in ſome caſes one may ſpeake of anothers faults behinde his backe, and yet be free from the ſin of backbiting. As, 1. If one be examined by lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whether he know this or that by another. That precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſs againſt thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> as it expreſſely forbids to witneſs that which is falſe of another, whether preſent or abſent; ſo it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely commands to witneſs what is true of another, whether preſent or abſent, if one be lawfully called unto it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One may ſpeak of anothers faults behinde his back, and yet be noe backbiter, when he ſpeakes to one that hath authority over him of whom he ſpeakes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeakes that he may reforme him. Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> told his father of the faults of his brethren behinde their backe, Gen. 37.2. And they of the houſe of <hi>Chloe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Paul</hi> of the faults that were among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. They were not guilty of backbiting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſpake to ſuch as might re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orme thoſe of whom they ſpake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. One may ſpeake evil of another behinde his backe to that end, that he to whom he ſpeakes, may beware of him of whom he ſpeakes, that he may be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or infected by him; and in this caſe he is free from backbiting. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake evil of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copperſmith behinde his backe ſaying, <hi>Alexander the Copperſmith hath done me much evil:</hi> but it was that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> might beware of him; <hi>Of whom be thou ware alſo; for he greatly withſtood our words,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.14, 15. So <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:52962:47"/> ſpake evil of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> behinde his backe; <hi>I wrote unto the Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preheminence among them, receiveth us not, wherefore if I come, I will remember his deeds, which he doth, prating against us with malitious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himſelf receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and caſteth them out of the Church.</hi> Why did <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeake thus of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> behinde his backe? It was that <hi>Gaius,</hi> to whom he wrote, might take heed of following ſuch an evil example. <hi>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that wich is good,</hi> 3 John 9.10, 11. But if there be no ſuch juſt occaſion to ſpeake, he that ſpeakes evil of another behinde his backe, is guilty of the ſin of backbiting. Now one kinde of backbiting there is, which is called whiſpering, and tale-bearing, to wit, when one ſpeakes evil of another behinde his backe in a cloſe and ſecret manner, to that end that he may make variance betwixt him of whom, and him to whom, he ſpeaketh. <hi>A whiſperer ſeparateth chiefe friends,</hi> Prov. 16.28. <hi>Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: ſo where there is no tale-bearer, the ſtrife ceaſeth,</hi> Prov. 26, 20. <hi>Aquinas</hi> makes whiſpering (or tale-bearing) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of ſin diſtinct from backbiting;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aquin.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 74. <hi>art.</hi> 1.</note> but ſo far as I ſee, they differ only as <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> backbiting being more general then whiſpering or tale-bearing; for every whiſperer of tale-bearer is a backbiter, but every backbiter is not a whiſperer or tale-bearer. <hi>Aquinas</hi> grants that a whiſperer is both in reſpect of matter, to wit, the thing ſpoken, which is ſome evil of another, and alſo in reſpect of forme, to wit, the manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which is behinde ones backe, the ſame with a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter; only they differ (he ſaith) in the end, in that a backbiter ſpeakes evil of one behinde his backe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame him; and a whiſperer doth it to ſet him and ſome other at variance. But this (I thinke) ſufficeth not to make them divers kindes of vices, but that ſtill the one is comprehended in the other. For as a backbiter doth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52962:47"/> ſpeak evil of a man behinde his backe to defame him, ſo alſo doth a whiſperer; though he doe it ſecretly, yet he doth it to defame a man, to blemiſh his reputation, and to make him ill thought of by him to whom he ſpeaketh, and ſo by that means to ſow diſcord betwixt them. So that whiſpering (as to me it ſeemeth) is backbiting, though a ſpecial kinde of backbiting, and of the worſt ſort.</p>

               <p n="1">1. All evil ſpeaking of others is forbidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and therefore backbiting, which is a ſpeaking evil of others. <hi>Thou fitteſt and ſpeakeſt againſt thy brother,</hi> ſaith God to the wicked, taxing him for this as one part of his wickedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.20. <hi>Paul</hi> bids put Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in minde <hi>to ſpeake evil of no man,</hi> Tit. 3.1, 2. <hi>Speake not evil one of another, brethren,</hi> ſaith <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 4.11.</p>

               <p>Some think ſo much the better of themſelves, by how

               <p n="2">2. A railer plainly profeſſeth his hatred againſt him on whom he raileth, and ſo they that heare him will the leſſe regard what he ſpeaketh: but a backbiter (as I have noted before) will diſſemble his hatred, and pretend love towards him of whom he ſpeaketh, ſo that his words are the more apt to be beleeved; <hi>they goe down into the innermoſt parts of the belly,</hi> Proverb. 18.8. and 26.22.</p>
               <p>Againe 2. a backbiter is worſe then a thiefe. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A thiefe only takes away a mans goods; but a backbiter takes away a mans good name, which is of more value. <hi>A good name is rather to be choſen then great riches,</hi> Prov. 22.1. <hi>A good name is better then pretious ointment,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.1.

Therefore they ought not to traduce and ſlander them, to carry tales abroad, and to backbite them. So for children to backbite their parents, is a thing moſt deteſtable.

               <p>Again, as all ought to eſchew backbiting, ſo by how much any doe the more profeſſe piety and religion, by ſo much they ought to have the more care to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free from this ſin. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. And this is one thing, which eſpecially doth open the mouthes of profane and irreligious people, to ſpeake evil of profeſſours and their profeſſion, becauſe ſome profeſſours are ſo prone to cenſure others, and to ſpeak evil of them behinde their backes. Therefore if we would adorne our profeſſion, and ſtop the mouthes of ſuch as are ill affected towards it, let us have care to eſchew backbiting. <hi>For ſo is the will of God</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that with well doing ye put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.15.</p>

The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaking of the times of the Goſpel, and of the kingdome of Chriſt, his kingdome of grace here, ſheweth what diſpoſition the true people of Chirſt ſhall be of; <hi>The wolfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall dwell with the lambe, and the leopard ſhall lie down with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52962:54"/> the kid; and the calfe and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them. And the cow and the beare ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lie down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the lion ſhall eate ſtraw like the oxe. And the ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the aſpe, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the cockatrice den. They ſhall not hurt, nor deſtroy in all mine holy mountaine: for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea,</hi> Iſai. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. Such as before had been like which leopards, lions, beares, aſpes and cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices, moſt cruel and devouring, moſt hurtful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, ſhall become moſt tame and mild, moſt gentle and peaceable; this is the diſpoſition of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt, that are partakers of his kingdome of grace here, and ſhall be partakers of his kingdome of glory hereafter. So alſo the ſame Prophet in another place, <hi>The wolfe and the lambe ſhall feed together, and the lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the bullocke; and duſt ſhall be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents meat: they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all mine holy mountaine, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſai. 65.25. The elect, and ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, are called ſheepe, <hi>John</hi> 10.27. and they are compared unto ſheepe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.33. which intimates that they are meeke and quiet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and harmeleſs: ſuch they are after that they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called. <hi>Paul</hi> bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Act. 9.1. But after that he was called and converted unto Chriſt, he became a lambe, one that would not doe the leaſt harme to any. Memorable to this purpoſe is that ſpeech of his to king <hi>Agrippa,</hi> when <hi>Agrippa</hi> told him, that he did almoſt perſwade him to be a Chriſtian, <hi>I would to God</hi>

When ſome of his diſciples were offended at the Samaritanes for refuſing to entertaine them, and thereupon asked him if they ſhould call for fire from heaven to conſume them, alledging the example of <hi>Elias</hi> for it, he rebuked them, ſaying, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luke 9.54, 55. On the other ſide, the devil <hi>was a murtherer from the beginning,</hi> John 8.44. <hi>Like a roaring lion he goes about ſeeking whom he may devoure,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52962:56"/> yet do little think, nor perhaps will eaſily be perſwaded that they are ſo, yea it may be will take it ill that any ſhould ſo judge of them. Such as put their cattel to feed in other mens grounds, or wittingly treſpaſſe upon them any ſuch way: ſuch as break their neighbours fences, carry away their hedges, and the like. What is all this elſe, but plain ſtealing? But whoſoever doe evil to their neighbour this way, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſtealing, let them conſider what the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> denounceth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, <hi>Every one that ſtealeth, ſhall be cut off,</hi> Zach. 5.3.

But whoſoever they be, whether rich or poor, that are guilty in this kinde, let them know and conſider, that oppreſſion is a ſin, whereby God is eſpecially provoked. This is mentioned as one of thoſe great abominations, for which the wrath of God came upon Jeruſalem; <hi>The people of the land have uſed oppreſſion, and exerciſed robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and have vexed the poore and needy: yea they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the ſtranger wrongfully,</hi> Ezek. 22.29. <hi>Woe to them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Micah) that deviſe iniquity, and work evil upon their beds: when the morning is light, they practiſe it, becauſe it is in the power of their hand.

For (as the ſon of <hi>Sirach</hi> alſo well obſerves) <hi>many therefore have refuſed to lend, for other mens ill dealing, fearing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded,</hi> Eccleſ. 29.7.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By begging, when there is no juſt cauſe for it. As when they pretend want that have none. <hi>There is that maketh himſelf poor, yet hath great riches,</hi> Pro. 13.7. So when they live by begging, who are able to take pains, and work for their living. <hi>When we were with you,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Theſſalonians) <hi>this we comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat. For we hear that there are ſome among you that walk diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, not working at all, but are buſy-bodies. Now them that are ſuch, we command, and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſs they work, and eat their own bread,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.10, 11, 12. They that doe not work, when they are able to maintayn themſelves, but live on the labour of others, as many young luſty beggers doe, they do not eat their own bread, they get that which they eat unjuſtly, they have no true right to it. Such wrong not only thoſe of whom they receive relief, but alſo thoſe that are poore indeed, and either are not able to work, or have ſo great a charge that they are not able to maintayn it by their work: that which is due unto ſuch as theſe, the other intercept. <hi>Honour wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, that are widowes indeed,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 5.3. So, relieve the poore, that are poor indeed. <hi>If any man or woman</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that beleeveth, have wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, let them relieve them, and let not the Church be charged, that it may relieve them that are widowes indeed,</hi> verſ. 16. Such as are either able to maintayn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or have friends able to maintayn them, ought not to be chargeable unto others.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By gaming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as carding, dicing, and the like. Though I doe not hold all gaming (not ſuch as wherein a lot is uſed) ſimply unlawful; yee it is not lawful for

Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently therefore it muſt needs be unlawful for any to get mens goods from them by ſuch meanes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. By cauſing any to ſpend and waſt their eſtate by drinking, rioting, &amp;c.

And if a man ſmite the eye of his ſervant, or the eye of his maid, that it periſh, he

                  </note> that rather then they would ſuffer their bodies to be defiled by their heatheniſh perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, they caſt themſelves into a river, and ſo were drowned. Indeed this is no lawful courſe for any to take. For if we muſt not doe evil, that good may come, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. then ſurely we may not do evil that evil may not come. We may not hurt our ſelves, that ſo we may prevent others leſt they ſhould hurt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtine</hi> therefore knew not well what to ſay of thoſe Chriſtian woman, that drowned themſelves rather then they would be defiled. He ſaith that perhaps they did it by ſome ſpecial inſtinct from
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52962:59"/> God, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> is ſuppoſed to have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf after that manner. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that it is not lawful (to wit, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, without extraordinarie warrant from God for it) for any to kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either to prevent the violation of their chaſtity, or for any other cauſe whatſoever. But yet ſuch examples (namely, of thoſe who have killed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either becauſe they have been, or leſt they ſhould be defiled) ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I ſay, ſhew what an horrible injury they do others, who abuſe them in that manner. When <hi>Amnon</hi> would needs force <hi>Thamar</hi> to lie with him, <hi>Nay, my brother</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>do not force me: for no ſuch thing ought to be done in Iſrael: do not thou this folly. And I, whither ſhall I cauſe my ſhame to goe?</hi> 2 Sam. 13.12, 13. And if this be done not by violence and conſtraint, but by perſwaſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement, then the injury is farre greater, in that evil is done not only to the body, but to the ſoul alſo; which particular is in the next place to be touched.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some do evil to others in reſpect of their ſoule, by drawing them into ſin. Theſe are moſt injurious of all, and the moſt miſchievous. The Apoſtle magnifying the grace of God in Chriſt towards him, ſaith, that he had been <hi>injurious,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.12. And how injurious he had been, he ſhewes in another place; ſaying, <hi>Many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I puniſhed them oft in every ſynagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme,</hi> Act. 26.10, 11. <hi>R. Salomon</hi> acutely obſerves,<note place="margin">R. Sal. in Deut. 23.7. &amp; in Hoſ. 12. ult.</note> that a ſeverer law is made againſt the Moabites and Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, who drew the Iſraelites into ſin, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. then againſt the Egyptians and Edomites, whereof the one drowned the male-children of the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. and the other came out againſt them with the ſword, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.20. The Lord commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52962:60"/> 
                  <hi>Vex the Midianites, and ſmite them. For they vex you with their wiles, therewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi,</hi> &amp;c. Num. 25. verſ. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Guilty alſo this way (<hi>viz.</hi> of doing evil to mens ſouls) are all open and notorious ſinners, who infect others by their evil example. <hi>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpe,</hi> 1 Corinth. 5.6. <hi>One ſinner deſtroyeth much good,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.18. <hi>One roote of bitterneſs ſpringing up,</hi> is enough <hi>to trouble and defile many,</hi> Heb. 12.15. Miſchievous unto the ſouls of others alſo are ſeducers and falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. They are called <hi>ravening wolves,</hi> Matth. 7.15. <hi>Grievous wolves, not ſparing the flock,</hi> Act. 20.29. If any one appeare to be of this ſtampe, a broacher of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical and damnable doctrine, <hi>Receive him not into your houſe,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>John) neither bid him, God ſpeed. For he that biddeth him God ſpeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is partaker of his evils deeds,</hi> 2 John 10. and 11. Chap. Such alſo are all hinderers of the word of God, and of the meanes of mens ſalvation. When <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> deſired to heare the word preached by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Elymas</hi> a ſorcerer withſtood them, and ſought to turn the deputy from the faith, <hi>Paul</hi> being full of the Holy Ghoſt, ſet his eyes upon him, and ſaid unto him, <hi>O full of all ſubtilty and all miſchiefe thou child of the devill, thou enemy of all righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of the Lord? And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou ſhalt be blinde, not ſeeing the ſun for a ſeaſon.</hi> Which ſentence was immediately executed; <hi>And immediately there fell on him a miſt, and a darkneſs; and he went about ſeeking ſome to lead him by the hand,</hi> Act. 13.10, 11. So the Jews both refuſing to heare the Goſpel themſelves, and alſo ſeeking to deprive the Gentiles of it, this brought the full vials of Gods wrath upon them. <hi>Forbidding us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle of them) <hi>to ſpeake unto the Gentiles, that they might be ſaved, to fill up their ſins alway: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the uttermoſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.16. Of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52962:60"/> this ſort of evil doers alſo are they, who do not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their place and calling indeavour to bring others to the truth, and to build them up in it. They are guilty of the blood of others, even of the blood of their ſouls. <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the houſe of Iſrael: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die, and thou giveſt him not warning, nor ſpeakeſt to warne the wicked from his wicked way to ſave his life: the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand,</hi> Ezel. 3.17, 18. And v. 20. <hi>Again, when a righteous man doth turne from his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and commit iniquity, and I lay a ſtumbling block before him, he ſhall die: becauſe thou haſt not given him warning, he ſhall die in his ſin, and his righteouſneſs which he hath done ſhall not be remembred; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> So alſo Ezek. 33.7, 8. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore taking his leave of ſome among whom he had lived after that he was called to the work of the miniſtry, <hi>I take you to record this day</hi> (ſaid he unto them) <hi>that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not ſhunned to declare unto you the whole counſel of God,</hi> Act. 20.26, 27. Neither doth this only concerne Miniſters, though them eſpecially, but alſo others; <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him,</hi> Levit. 19.17. Thoſe who thus or any other way doe evill to mens ſouls, are eſpecially like unto the devil, whoſe chief ſpite is at the ſouls of men; them he chiefly labours to deſtroy. <hi>The devil put it into the heart of Judas to betray Chriſt,</hi> John 13.2. becauſe he knew that <hi>Judas</hi> thereby would betray his own ſoule. It was <hi>Satan that filled the heart of Ananias to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 5.3. He is called <hi>the tempter,</hi> Matth. 4.3. And 1 <hi>Theſs</hi> 3.5. becauſe he is ever tempting to ſin one way or other.</p>
               <p>Now this ſin of doing evil unto others, is aggravated divers wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52962:61"/>1. In reſpect of the perſons by whom it is done. As;</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they be ſuch as by their place and calling, or profeſſion of friendſhip, and truſt repoſed in them, ought to protect and defend others from harme. For <hi>Ananias</hi> ſitting as a judge, to cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> unjuſtly to be ſmitten, was far worſe then if another had done it. <hi>Sitteſt thou</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> unto him) <hi>to judge me after the law, and commandeſt me to be ſmitten contrary to the law?</hi> Act. 23.3. So <hi>David</hi> aggravates the evil that was done unto him, ſaying, <hi>Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me,</hi> Pſal. 41.9. <hi>For it was not an enemy that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me, then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me</hi> (to wit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>penly and profeſſedly) <hi>that did magnifie himſelf againſt me, then I would have hid my ſelf from him. But it was thou, a man, mine equall, my guide, and mine acquaintance; we tooke ſweet counſel together, and walked unto the houſe of God in company,</hi> Pſal. 55.12, 13, 14. <hi>Judas</hi> by this ſhewed himſelf to be <hi>a devil,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Chriſt termed him, <hi>John</hi> 6.70.) that being one of Chriſts Apoſtles, he betrayed him, <hi>John</hi> 6.71.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as reproove and condemne others for doing evill to their neighbour, and yet do ſo themſelves. <hi>Thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt: for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt, doeſt the ſame things,</hi> Rom. 2.1. <hi>Thou therefore that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteale, doeſt thou ſteale? Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit adultery, doeſt thou commit adultery?</hi> verſ. 21. and 22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that have been much and oft admoniſhed to refraine from doing evil to their neighbour, and yet do it. <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of hoſts, ſaying, Execute true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſhew mercy and compaſſion every man to his brother. And oppreſſe not the widow, nor the fatherleſs, the ſtranger, nor the poore, and let none of you imagine evil againſt his brother in your heart. But they refuſed to hearken, and pulled away
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52962:61"/> the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears that they ſhould not heare. Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant-ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hoſts hath ſent in his Spirit by the former Prophets:</hi> (this was the aggravation of their ſin) <hi>therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hoſts,</hi> &amp;c. Zach. 7.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as have been convinced of the evil which they have unjuſtly done unto others, and confeſſed it, promiſing to do ſo no more, and yet do it. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> was convinced of his injurious dealing with <hi>David,</hi> he did confeſſe it, and promiſe that he would deſiſt from it. This we finde 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16, &amp;c. Yet when he ſaw his opportunity, he fell to perſecute <hi>David</hi> as much as ever, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.1, 2. And though again he confeſſed his fault, and promiſed amendment, ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned: returne, my ſon David, for I will no more do thee harme,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Sam. 26.21. yet the Scripture intimates, that <hi>Saul</hi> would ſtill have perſecuted <hi>David,</hi> but that <hi>David</hi> fled into another country and ſo got him out of <hi>Sauls</hi> reach. And it was told <hi>Saul, That David was fled to Gath, and he ſought no more for him,</hi> 1 Sam. 27 4. Becauſe he ſaw he had no hope to find him, otherwiſe he would have ſought him ſtill; his heart was ſtill malitiouſly bent againſt him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Evil is aggravated in reſpect of the perſons to whom it is done. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be done to parents. <hi>He that ſmiteth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his mother, ſhall be ſurely put to death,</hi> Exod 21.15. <hi>And he that curſeth his father or his mother, ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> verſ. 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If evil be done to Magiſtrates. When <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Saul</hi> at advantage, and ſome perſwaded him to lay hold on the opportunity, and to free himſelf from ever being moleſted by him any more, <hi>The Lord forbid</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I ſhould do this thing unto my Maſter the Lords anointed, to ſtretch forth mine hand againſt him, ſeeing he is the anointed of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.6. And again, when upon the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage <hi>Abiſhai</hi> deſired <hi>David</hi> to let him ſmite <hi>Saul,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52962:62"/> David</hi> would not give way to it, ſaying, <hi>Deſtroy him not, for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi> 1 Sam. 26.9. <hi>Curſe not the king, no not in thy thought,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.20.

For when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> burnt incenſe in an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous manner, his hand did not drie up; but when he offered to doe violence to the Prophet, then it dried up. So when the people of the Jews <hi>mocked the meſſengers of God, and miſuſed his Prophets, then the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt them, till there was no remedy. Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Chron. 36.16, 17. &amp;c <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,</hi> (ſaid our Saviour) <hi>thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee: how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; and ye would not?

So the Apoſtle requires that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>be obedient into their Maſters, and pleaſe them well in all things, not anſwering again.

               <p n="5">5. The evil alſo that is done to others is aggravated, if it be done to thoſe that are profeſſours of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſuch as have ſpecial relation unto God, and in a peculiar manner belong unto him. <hi>Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded? Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.7, 8. Though they were Jews, or Turks, or whatſoever they were, yet they were not to be wronged, or defrauded; much leſſe are brethren, Chriſtians, ſuch as profeſſe the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, to be ſo uſed. How grievous then is their ſin, who the more any appeare to be religious and godly, the more they ſeek to do them hurt? ſuch eſpecially ſhew themſelves to be of their father the devil, who is the profeſſed enemy of God,<note place="margin">Plus poſſidetur à diabolo, qui non ſolum ipſe malus eſt, verum etiam gratis odit ſervientes Deo? <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> and of thoſe that have any thing of God in them. <hi>Cain was of the wicked one</hi> (that is, the devil) <hi>and ſlew his brother: and wherefore ſlew he him? becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.12. How God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52962:63"/> againſt ſuch as do evil to his people, may appeare by his dealing with <hi>Amalek</hi> for this very cauſe. Becauſe when the Iſraelites were travelling towards Canaan, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malek</hi> came and fought againſt them, God commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Write this for a memorial in a booke, and rehearſe it in the eares of Joſhua; for I will utterly put out the name of Amalek from under heaven,</hi> Exod. 17.8, 14. And verſ. 16. <hi>The Lord hath ſworne, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> a little before his death, put the people in minde of this; <hi>Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt. How he met thee by the way, and ſmote the hindmoſt of thee, even all that were feeble behinde thee, when thou waſt faint and weary: and he feared not God Therefore ſhall it be, when the Lord thy God hath given thee reſt from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to poſſeſſe it, that thou ſhalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou ſhalt not forget it,</hi> Deut. 25.17, 18, 19. And though God did long (even 400. years) deferre to execute vengeance upon the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites, yet he did not forget the injury which they did unto his people, but when <hi>Saul</hi> was king, he ſent <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> unto him, charging him to goe, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them for it. <hi>I remember</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that which Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek did to Iſrael,</hi> (though <hi>Amalek,</hi> it is likely, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it, yet the Lord did remember it) <hi>how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. Now go, and ſmite Amalek, and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not, but ſlay both man and woman, infant and ſuckling, oxe and ſheep, camel and aſſe,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.2, 3. And becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> did not ſo fully execute this judgment as he ſhould have done, but ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> the king of the Amalekites, and the beſt of the cattel, therefore God would not ſpare him, but caſt him off, and transferred the kingdom to another.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If any do evil to thoſe that have done no evil to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52962:63"/> them, this alſo is an aggravation of the evil, and makes the ſin the greater. Indeed though other have done evil to us, yet we ought not therefore to doe evil unto them. <hi>Say not, I will do ſo to him, he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his deeds,</hi> Pro. 24.29. <hi>Recompenſe no man evil for evil. — Dearly beloved, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge not your ſelves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Therefore <hi>if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink. For in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coales of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good,</hi> Rom. 12.17, 19, 20, 21. Our Saviour would not do evil for evil; <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again; and when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. So that man after Gods own heart, <hi>David,</hi> though <hi>Saul did hunt his ſoul to take it,</hi> yet he would not avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on him when he had opportunity, but ſaid, <hi>The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me on thee; but mine hand ſhall not be upon thee. As ſaith the proverbe of the ancients, Wickedneſs proceedeth from the wicked; but mine hand ſhall not be upon thee,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.12, 13. But a far greater ſin it is, if we do them evil who have done us none. <hi>They deviſe deceitfull matters</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) againſt them that are quiet in the land;</hi> ſuch as neither meddle nor make with them, as we ſay, Pſal. 35.20. <hi>Wo unto thee that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled; and dealeſt treacherouſly, and they dealt not treacherouſly with thee.</hi> Iſai. 33.1.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Much worſe yet it is if any do evil to thoſe, who have done good to them. Thus <hi>Jonathan</hi> pleaded with his father <hi>Saul</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>David,</hi> when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <hi>Saul</hi> intended evil againſt him. <hi>Let not the king</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſin againſt his ſervant, againſt David; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not ſinned againſt thee,</hi> (and not only ſo, but) <hi>and becauſe his works have been to theeward very good. For he did put his life in his hand, and ſlew the Philiſtine, and

This <hi>David</hi> complaines ſore of; <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me evil for good, to the ſpoiling of my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 35. verſ. 12. This made <hi>Jeremie</hi> cry out, <hi>Shall evil be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed for good? for they have digged a pit for my ſoul: remember that I ſtood before thee to ſpeake good for them, and to turne away thy wrath from them,</hi> Jer. 18.20. Thus Chriſt did aggravate the ſin of <hi>Judas,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bread with me,</hi> (he whom I have ſo reſpected, ſo honoured, as to make him ſit with me at mine own ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <hi>hath lift up his heele againſt me,</hi>

               <p>I Have ſhewed how the evil that any do to others, is agravated:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the perſons by whom it is done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the perſons to whom it is done.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed, the evil that is done, is alſo aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52962:64"/> 3. in reſpect of the time when it is done. None ought to doe evil to others at any time; yet it is worſe if they do it at ſome time, then if they do it an another. When <hi>Gehazi</hi> had run after <hi>Naaman,</hi> and by forging a lie had gotten gifts of him, <hi>Eliſha</hi> aggravated his ſin in reſpect of the time when it was committed. <hi>Is it a time</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive-yards, and vineyards, and ſheep and oxen, and men-ſervants, and maid-ſervants?</hi> 2 King. 5.26. Surely there was no time for <hi>Gehazi,</hi> or any other to receive gifts in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he did; but leaſt of all was it to be done at that time when he did it. For now <hi>Naaman</hi> of a heatheniſh idolater was newly become a proſelyte, he was newly converted to the Jewiſh religion, profeſſing that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he would offer neither burnt-offering nor ſacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.17. For <hi>Gehazi</hi> therefore now at this time to defraud and cheat <hi>Namaan</hi> as he did, might have been enough both to alienate <hi>Naaman</hi> from his newly embraced religion, and alſo to make it odious unto others, whom otherwiſe <hi>Naaman,</hi> and the cure wrought upon him, might have been a meanes to convert unto it. Thus alſo the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> taxeth ſome not only for doing evil to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but alſo for doing it at ſuch a time when eſpecially they ought not to have done it. <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the day of your faſt you finde pleaſure, and exact all your labours,</hi> (or, as the marginal reading hath it, <hi>Things wherewith you grieve others.) Behold, you faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs: ye ſhall not faſt as you do to day, to make your voice to be heard on high,</hi> Iſai. 58. verſ. 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The evil which ſome do to others, is aggravated in reſpect of the manner how they do it, and that divers wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When any Plot and ſtudie, deviſe and imagine evil againſt others. This was an aggravation of the ſin of <hi>Judas</hi> in betraying Chriſt, the Jewiſh rulers having
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52962:65"/> covenanted with him for 30. pieces of ſilver, <hi>from that time forth he ſought opportunity to betray him,</hi> Matt. 26.16. Thus alſo <hi>David</hi> aggravated the evil that <hi>Doeg</hi> did to him and others; <hi>Thy tongue deviſeth miſchiefe,</hi> (ſaid he unto him) <hi>like a ſharpe raſor, working deceitfully,</hi> Pſal. 52.2. <hi>He that deviſeth to do evil,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) ſhall be called a miſchievous perſon,</hi> Prov. 24.8. That indeed ſhewes a miſchievous diſpoſition, even the diſpoſition of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who <hi>goeth about ſeeking whom he may devoure,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaking of a naughty and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon, he deſcribes him by this; <hi>Frowardneſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in his heart, he deviſeth miſchiefe continually, he ſoweth diſcord.</hi> Then he addes, <hi>Therefore ſhall his calamity come ſuddenly, ſuddenly ſhall he be broken without remedy,</hi> Pro. 6. verſ. 14, 15. And immediately after, ſpeaking of thoſe things, which the Lord doth hate, and which are an abomination unto him, among the reſt he reckons this for one, <hi>A heart that deviſeth wicked imaginations,</hi> v. 18. The Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> cryes wo to thoſe that are guilty in this kind. <hi>Wo to them that deviſe iniquity, and work miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe upon their beds, Mic.</hi> 2.1. When they ſhould be ſleeping, they are ſtudying how to do miſchief. But as they deviſe evil againſt others, ſo the Prophet tels them God will deviſe evil againſt them, verſ. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When any take pleaſure and delight in doing evil to others. <hi>Their feet run to evil, and make haſt to ſhed blood,</hi> Prov. 1.16. <hi>Who rejoyce to do evil,</hi> Prov. 2.14. <hi>They ſleep not, except they have done miſchiefe; and their ſleep is taken away, unleſs they cauſe ſome to fall,</hi> Pro. 4.16. Among thoſe things that are odious and abominable in the ſight of God, he reckons <hi>feet, that be ſwift in running to miſchief;</hi> becauſe that argues a great delight in it, Prov. 6.18. <hi>He that is glad at calamities,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall not be unpuniſhed,</hi> Prov. 17.5. Though he be not the author of thoſe calamities, yet if he be glad at them, he ſhall not eſcape puniſhment; much leſſe ſhall he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if he both be the author of them, and alſo be glad at them.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52962:65"/>3. When any do evil to others under a ſhew of love and good affection, which they beare towards them. <hi>The words of his mouth</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) were ſmoother then butter, but war was in his heart: his words were ſofter then oil, yet were they drawn ſwords,</hi> Pſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Saul</hi> pretended much love and reſpect to <hi>David,</hi> he would needs make him his ſon in law; but it was that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be a ſnare unto him, and that by that meanes he might work his ruine, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. So <hi>Abſalom</hi> made as if <hi>Amnon</hi> were very deare unto him, by all meanes he muſt have him a gheſt at his table; but it was only to this end, that ſo he might cauſe his ſervants to ſlay him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. Thus alſo <hi>Joab</hi> under a pretence of love treacherouſly ſlew firſt <hi>Abner,</hi> and after that <hi>Amaſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. and 20. Chap. <hi>Joab took Abner aſide in the gate, to ſpeak with him quietly, and ſmote him there under the fifth rib, that he died.</hi> In like manner he dealt with <hi>Amaſa,</hi> or rather worſe; <hi>Art thou in health, my brother?</hi> (ſaid he unto him) <hi>and he took him by the beard to kiſſe him, and then ſmote him in the fifth rib, and ſhed out his bowels to the ground.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Judas</hi> pretended love and reſpect to Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Haile Maſter, and kiſſing him;</hi> but by that meanes he betrayed him into the hands of thoſe that ſought his life. <hi>Iudas, betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs?</hi> ſaid Chriſt unto him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.48. It was too bad to betray him it all, but much worſe to do it in that manner.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The evil that is done to any, is aggravated, when it is done under a forme of juſtice. As <hi>Ahab</hi> by the Counſel of <hi>Jezabel</hi> cauſed <hi>Naboth</hi> to be accuſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and put to death as one that had blaſphemed God and the king, when indeed he was guilty of no ſuch thing, but <hi>Ahab</hi> would by any meanes have his life, that ſo he might have his vineyard, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. Thus alſo the adverſaries of our Saviour dealt with him, they urged
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52962:66"/> 
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemne him that he might be crucified; and when <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>What accuſation do you bring againſt this man?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quae venit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignè poena, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenda venit. <hi>Ovid.</hi>
                  </note> they anſwered, <hi>If he were not a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, we would not have delivered him up unto thee,</hi> John 18.29, 30. This is <hi>to turne judgment to worm-wood,</hi> Amos 5.7. to make that which ſhould be moſt ſweet, to be moſt bitter. See alſo <hi>Amos</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When any under pretence of piety and religion do evil to their neighbour, this is a great aggravation of it. As the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> pretending that they might not joyne in affinity with ſuch as were uncircumciſed, and had not the badge of their religion, by that meanes got the men of Schechem to circumciſe themſelves; and then when they were ſore, and not able to ſtand up in their own defence, they came upon them, and ſlew them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. So <hi>Abſalom,</hi> under a colour of religion, he had made a vow (forſooth,) and muſt needs go to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> to pay it; thus did he conſpire againſt <hi>David,</hi> and ſought to take away both life and kingdome from him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>Ahab</hi> alſo and <hi>Jezebel</hi> ſeeking how to get the life and vineyard of <hi>Naboth,</hi> they pretended religion and piety; they proclaimed a faſt, that ſo they might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their deſigne againſt <hi>Naboth,</hi> and cauſe him to be put to death as a blaſphemer; it being the cuſtome (it ſeemes) among the Iſraelites, in their ſolemne faſts to inquire more ſtrictly into mens wayes, and to inflict pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment more ſeverely upon tranſgreſſours, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.

The very heathens, who had nothing but the light and law of nature to direct them, had lawes againſt murther, theft, and the like.

Had he been any thing, but a <hi>Nabal</hi> (that is, a foole) he might have known, that his bread, his water, his fleſh, whatſoever he had, was not ſo his, but that he was bound to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute to ſuch as ſtood in need. <hi>As every one hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the gift</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Peter) ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10. They are therefore injurious unto others, and deprive them of their due, who ſeeing them in need, and being able to helpe them, yet will not do it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such as refuſe to do good unto others when they may and ought, not only withhold their right from them, but alſo are guilty of all the evill that for want of ſuccour and reliefe doth befall them. When ſome watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour to ſee whether he would heale a man on the Sabbath day,<note place="margin">Paſce fame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientem, ſi non paveris, occidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti?</note> he ſaid unto them, <hi>Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath dayes, or to do evil? to ſave life, or to kill?</hi> Mark 3.4. Which words imply, that not to do good, when ability ſerves, and occaſion requires,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52962:71"/> is to do evil; not to ſave life in this caſe, is to kill.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Life and ſalvation is promiſed to, and conferred upon ſuch as are careful rightly to performe this duty: and on the other ſide, death and damnation is threatned to, and inflicted upon ſuch as neglect it. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertaine riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy: That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, willing to communicate; Laying up in ſtore for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17, 18, 19. As theſe good works are fruits of faith, <hi>which worketh through love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. So they ſhall procure a reward, and that no leſſe then eternal life. Though they be not meritorious, nor properly deſerve any reward, much leſſe ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>When ye have done all thoſe things that are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſay, We are unprofitable ſervants; we have done that which was our duty to do,</hi> Luke 17.10. The Apoſtle having ſpoken of the good that <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> did unto him; how he oft refreſhed him, and was not aſhamed of his chaine, but when he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> (where the Apoſtle was a priſoner) ſought him out very diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and found him; <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>grant unto him, that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. verſ. 16, 17, 18. So that the reward of well-doing is of Gods mercy, not of mans merit.<note place="margin">Meritum meus eſt miſeratio Domini. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                  </note> Yet rewarded it ſhall be, even with <hi>the reward of the inheritance,</hi> Col. 3. verſ. 24. <hi>That inheritance, which is incorruptible, and undefiled, and fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> (will Chriſt ſay to the elect at the laſt day) <hi>inherit you the kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye fed me; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 25.34, &amp;c. They did it to him in his members, as he preſently explaines it. On the otherſide, to the reprobate he will ſay, <hi>Depart from me,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52962:72"/> ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungred, and ye fed me not; thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and ye gave me no drink,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 25.41, &amp;c. And the rich man mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 16. was caſt into hell, not (that we read) for oppreſſing, or doing evil unto others; but only for not doing good unto them. So it is ſaid, <hi>Every tree</hi> (not only that bringeth forth evil fruit, but) <hi>that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down, and caſt into the fire,</hi> Matt. 3.10. And the barren figtree is threatned to be cut down, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now in doing good to others obſerve theſe directions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do it whiles time and opportunity ſerveth. <hi>As we have opportunity, let us do good,</hi> Gal. 6.10. Some when they die it may be will do ſomething in this kinde, but while they live they will do nothing. But conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thou putteſt off thy doing good till thou dieſt, thou canſt not tell whether the good thou intendeſt, ever ſhall be done or no. <hi>Executours</hi> (as one ſaith well and wittily) <hi>oft proove Executioners;</hi> that which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended one way, is oft imployed another way quite contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to do good until death is not ſo acceptable either to God or man. <hi>Not grudgingly, nor of neceſſity;</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for God loveth a chearful giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.7. But if thou wilt do nothing while thou liveſt, it appears that thou doſt it grudgingly and of neceſſity:<note place="margin">Munera, quae tibi dat moriens, ea munera non ſunt.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou canſt no longer hold it thy ſelf, therefore thou parteſt with it to others; if thou mighteſt live alwayes, thou wouldeſt never (it ſeemes) do any good to others at all. Therefore (as <hi>Salomon</hi> exhorts) <hi>in the morning ſow thy ſeed,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.6. Begin betimes to do good: be like <hi>Dorcas,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>ſhe was full of good works, and almes-deeds which ſhe did,</hi> Act. 9.36. When ſhe was dead, the widowes ſhewed <hi>Peter</hi> the coats and garments, which ſhe had made while ſhe was with them, verſ. 39.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Continue ſo doing. <hi>As we have opportunity, let us
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52962:72"/> do good,</hi> Gal. 6.10. that is, both whiles we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and alſo as long as we have opportunity. <hi>Let us not be wearie of well doing; for in due time we ſhall reape, if we faint not,</hi> Gal. 6.9. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening let not thine hand be ſtill,</hi> Eccleſ. 6. Begin betimes, and hold out unto the end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do good to all, as occaſion requireth, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſerveth. <hi>As we have opportunity,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let us do good unto all men,</hi> Gal. 6.10. To ſome indeed more eſpecially we ought to do it, as the Apoſtle there addes, <hi>eſpecially to thoſe that are of the houſhold of faith.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaith that his goodneſs did extend to the ſaints, that is, to them principally, though not to them only, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. And our Saviour ſhewes that at the laſt day he will chiefly take notice of the good that was done, or not done to ſuch, namely the ſaints, and thoſe that are of the houſhold of faith. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Inaſmuch as ye have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, you have done it unto me, Matth.</hi> 25.40. And verſ. 45. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Inaſmuch as you have not done it to one of the leaſt of theſe, you did it not to me.</hi> So alſo <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> if other reſpects be alike, we are to do good to kinsfolks, friends and acquaintance ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to others, their neceſſities being as great as the neceſſities of others. The Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>Honour,</hi> that is, relieve <hi>widowes that are widowes indeed,</hi> that is, that are deſolate, and have none to provide for them; he addes immediately; <hi>But if any widow have children or nephewes, let them (viz.</hi> thoſe children or nephewes) <hi>learne to ſhew pietie</hi> (or as the margent hath it, <hi>kindneſs) at home, and to require their parents, for that is good and acceptable before God,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.3, 4. And verſ. 8. <hi>But if any provide not for his own, and chiefly for thoſe of his own houſe</hi> (or according to the marginal reading, <hi>kindred) he hath denied the faith, and is worſe then an infidel.</hi> Yet our beneficence muſt not be confined to ſome, and reſtramed from others, but it muſt be (ſo farre as we are able,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52962:73"/> extended unto all. Though they be wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet if need be, we muſt help, and ſuccour them. As we have opportunity we muſt do good, not only to thoſe that are of the houlſhold of faith, but unto all, therefore even ſo ſuch as are aliens from the faith, and enemies unto it. Our Saviour bids, <hi>Be ye merciful at your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is merciful,</hi> Luke 6.36. And immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, he ſhewes how merciful God is; <hi>For he is kinde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the unthankful and to the evil,</hi> verſ. 35. <hi>He maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt,</hi> Matth. 5.45.

See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. Thus indeed the wicked are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52962:73"/> not to be helped, not ſo as to maintaine them in their wickedneſs, but ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them their diſtreſſe,<note place="margin">In peccatore duo ſunt, culpa &amp; natura.

                  </note> they are to be helped. Again, although they be meere ſtrangers to us, ſuch as we never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor it may be ſhall ever ſee again, yet if the caſe and condition that they are in call for it, we ought to do them good. Our Saviour by a parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.30, &amp;c. teacheth us, that though one be otherwiſe never ſo much a ſtranger, yet we are to account him a neighbour; and if he ſtand in neede, to afford him ſuccour. Though they be ſuch as are never likely to make requital, yet we muſt not refuſe to do them good. <hi>If you do good</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for ſinners alſo do even the ſame,</hi> Luke 6.33. And verſ. 34. <hi>Do good</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and lend, hoping for nothing again,</hi> that is, not hoping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive again the like courteſy) <hi>and your reward ſhall be great in heaven, and ye ſhall be the children of the Higheſt.</hi> The more we do good to thoſe that are not able to requite us, the more we reſemble God, who doth good to all, but cannot be requited by any. And the leſſe able men are to requite us, the more will God requite us; if we do them good for his ſake. <hi>When thou makeſt a dinner, or a ſupper,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinſmen, nor thy rich neighbours,</hi> (only ſuch as are able, and likely to requite thy kindneſs) <hi>leſt they alſo bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blinde. And thou ſhalt be bleſſed, for they cannot recompence thee; for thou ſhalt be recompenced at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the juſt,</hi> Luke 14.12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Finally, though they be our enemies, yet if their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities require it, and we be able to doe it, we ought to do them good. <hi>If thou meet thine enemies oxe or his aſſe going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again. If thou ſee the aſſe of him that hateth thee, lying under his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52962:74"/> burthen, and wouldeſt forbear to help him, thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help with him,</hi> Exod. 23.4, 5. <hi>If thine enemy be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirſty, give him water to drink. For thou ſhalt heap coales of fire on his head,</hi> (either melt him with thy kindneſs, or bring more wrath upon him for his obſtinacy and ingratitude) <hi>and the Lord ſhall reward thee,</hi> Pro. 25.21, 22. Rom. 12.20. <hi>You have heard that it hath been ſaid, (viz.</hi> by the Scribes and Phariſees, who did put falſe gloſſes upon the law of God) <hi>thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I ſay unto you, Love your enemies; bleſſe them that curſe you; do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you,</hi> Mar. 5.43, 44,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do good to others, eſpecially in reſpect of their ſouls. <hi>Chriſt went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the devil,</hi> Act. 10.38. He healed thoſe that were oppreſſed of the devil corporally, but more eſpecially thoſe that were ſpiritually oppreſſed of him: his chief care was for the ſoule. So <hi>Paul</hi> eſpecially la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to do good to the ſouls of others; <hi>I will very gladly ſpend, and be ſpent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for you,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.15.

                  <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall ſay unto his brother, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> (which is a word of reproach and contempt) <hi>ſhall be in danger of the councill: but whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou foole,</hi> (which is a higher degree of reproach) <hi>ſhall be in danger of hel fire,</hi> Matth. 5.22. So <hi>Paul</hi> reckoneth <hi>revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> among thoſe that ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.

               <p>For the further proof of this point, there is the ſame argument as was uſed before in the point, of backbiting.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52962:75"/> For he that reproacheth another, though he ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is true, yet he wants love, becauſe he ſeeketh to diſgrace him, whom he reproacheth. Now <hi>he that ſaith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkneſs even until now. He that loveth his brother, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the light, and there is none occaſion of ſtumbling in him.

If that which he ſpeaketh by way of reproach be falſe, then wanting not only love, but truth alſo, he falls into further condemnation.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:52962:77"/>1. Reproaches though lightly and eaſily uttered, yet are not light and eaſie to be endured. Indeed they that are reproached,<note place="margin">Motives to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</note> ſhould conſider what it is for which they are reproached. If it be for ſin, they ſhould not be ſo much troubled at the reproach, as at the ſin which is the cauſe of it. <hi>David</hi> firſt prayed to be delivered from his ſins, and then from the reproach of men. <hi>Deliver me</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>from all my tranſgreſſions, and make me not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the fooliſh,</hi> Pſal. 39.8. If any be reproached for that wherein they are not faulty, they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to regard it. <hi>Hearken unto me ye that know righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>the people in whoſe heart is my law: feare ye not the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings. For the moth ſhall eat them up like a garment, and the worme ſhall eat them like wool: but my righteouſneſs ſhall be for ever, and my ſalvation from generation to generation,</hi> Iſai. 51.7, 8. And if (as many times it happeneth) any be reproached for wel-doing, they have reaſon to rejoyce in it. <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are you; for the ſpirit of glory, and of God reſteth on you: on their part he is evill ſpoken of, but on your part he is glorified,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.44. <hi>Bleſſed are ye</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſpeake all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake. Rejoyce and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven: for ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted they the Prophets which were before you,</hi> Matth. 5. verſ. 11, 12. Yet however reproach in it ſelf conſidered is very grievous, and hard to bear. <hi>Jeremie</hi> complains ſore of this, that he was mocked and derided, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.7, 8.<note place="margin">Habet enim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culeum quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, quem pati etiam prudentes difficillime poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt. <hi>Daven. in Col. 3.21.</hi>
                  </note> It made him even ready to give over the work that God did ſet him about, becauſe thereby he ſaw himſelf expoſed to reproach and deriſion. <hi>The word of the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was a reproach unto me, and a deriſion daily. Then I ſaid, I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay,</hi> Jerem. 20.8, 9. So the people of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52962:78"/> God make their complaint unto him, ſaying, <hi>Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt us a reproach to our neighbours, a ſcorne and a deriſion to them that are round about us,</hi> Pſal. 44.13. See alſo Pſal. 123.3, 4. So <hi>David</hi> in like manner complaines, <hi>Thou haſt known my reproach,</hi> (ſaith he unto God) <hi>and my ſhame, and my diſhonour; mine adverſaries are all before thee. Reproach hath broken mine heart, and I am full of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs,</hi> Pſal. 69.19, 20. <hi>Mockings</hi> are reckoned among the grievous perſecutions, which the godly endured, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Iſmaels</hi> mocking of <hi>Iſaac</hi> is called by the Apoſtle a perſecuting of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. verſ. 29.</p>

For it is God that both maketh rich, and maketh poor, as he pleaſeth. <hi>The rich and the poor meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the Lord is the maker of them all,</hi> Proverb. 22.2. <hi>The Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7. God might have made thee poore, and the other rich; yea for ought thou knoweſt he may yet doe it. So if thou re-reproacheſt others because of any affliction that they are in, conſider that God might have ſent, and yet may ſend the like affliction, or worſe upon thee. Beſides, ſuch as are poore, or any way afflicted, ought to be pitied, and ſuccoured if it may be. <hi>To him that is afflicted, pitie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52962:78"/> ſhould be ſhewed,</hi> &amp;c. Job 6.14. Do not then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches adde more affliction unto ſuch as are afflicted enough already. See what bitter imprecations <hi>David,</hi> not by his own ſpirit, but by ſpirit of God, doth powre out againſt thoſe <hi>that perſecute him, whom God hath ſmitten, and talke to the grief of thoſe whom he hath wounded,</hi> Pſal. 69 22,—26. Is it for ſin that any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach others? Yet even that is no juſt cauſe why they ſhould do it. If others ſin, we ſhould mourne and pray for them, and as we have opportunity admoniſh and reproove them, but not reproach them.</p>
               <p>For 1. This is the way to make them worſe and not better. It is true, God can bring light out of darkneſs, and make a reproach work for the converſion of a ſinner, as <hi>Auſtine</hi> relates that his mother by this meanes was reclaimed from a vice with which ſhe had been infected:<note place="margin">Aug.

                  </note> but the nature of reproach is ſuch, as that it is more apt to work a quite contrary effect. They that are reprooved, are ready to conſtrue it ſo as if they were reproached. <hi>Maſter,</hi> (ſaid one to Chriſt) <hi>thus ſaying, thou reprocheſt us alſo,</hi> Luke 11.45. This makes people ſo to diſtaſt reproof; how much more will they diſtaſt it, when it plainly appears that they are reproached? <hi>Salomon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires wiſdome in a reproover, as well as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in him that is reprooved. <hi>As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, ſo is a wiſe reproover upon an obedient eare,</hi> Prov. 25 12. Now the wiſdome of a reproover conſiſts much in this, that he reproove ſo as that it may appeare to be a reproofe, but not a reproach; that his aime and indeavour is to reforme, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Either thou haſt falne thy ſelf into as great ſin, or mayeſt fall; and this conſideration ſhould keepe from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching others, though it be for ſin. We ought <hi>to ſpeak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, ſhewing all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto all men.

Eſpecially if it appeare that one hath repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his ſin, he is not to be reproached for it, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with it. <hi>If the wicked will turne from all his ſins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him,</hi> Ezek. 18.21, 22. God will not mention them ſo as to impute them, therefore much leſſe ſhould we mention them ſo as to reproach for them. It is obſervable, that <hi>Matthew</hi> mentioning himſelf among the Apoſtles, calls himſelf <hi>the Publican, Matth.</hi> 10. verſ. 3. So magnifying the grace of Chriſt towards him in making him an Apoſtle, who had been a Publican: but <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> rehearſing the names of the Apoſtles, never terme him ſo, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.15. leſt they might ſeeme to reproach him. So <hi>Paul</hi> after he was converted and called to be an Apoſtle, for the ſame reaſon acknowledgeth what he had been, namely <hi>a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and injurious,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. But <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeaking of him, ſaith, <hi>Our beloved brother Paul,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.15. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> who had been a fugitive, one that had run away front his maſter, and (as it ſeemeth) had alſo purloyned from him, yet now that he was become a convert, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks moſt reſpectively and affectionately of him: <hi>I beſeech thee</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Philemon) for my ſon Oneſimus,</hi> &amp;c.

Therefore though thou doſt refraine from acting thy old ſins, yet if thou canſt ſtill think and ſpeak of thy former wayes and doings without being aſhamed of them, it argues that thy refraining from ſin doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome other cauſe, (as want of power, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to act in that kinde, or the like) and not from hence, that thou haſt tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, This may teach and admoniſh all, if they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> would keep themſelves from contempt, even from juſt and deſerved contempt, to keep themſelves from ſin and wickedneſs. If thou wouldſt avoid contempt, have a care to avoid ſin, for otherwiſe both God and they that are of God will contemne thee. <hi>When the wicked cometh, then cometh alſo contempt, and with ignonimy reproach,</hi> Proverb. 18.3. It is not thy birth or breeding, not thy wit or wealth, not thy dignity or power, not any thing whatſoever that can preſerve thee from contempt, if thou beeſt wicked. No, if thou liveſt wickedly, thou ſhalt live contemptibly; and if thou dieſt in thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, contempt will for ever cleave unto thee. <hi>The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the juſt is bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Prov. 10.7. When the wicked riſe again, it ſhall be <hi>to perpetual ſhame and contempt,</hi> Dan. 12.2. <hi>They ſhall be an abhorring unto all fleſh,</hi> Iſai. 66.24.</p>
               <p>But fourthly, if it be one character whereby a citizen <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>4</label> of heaven, and an heire of ſalvation is deſcribed, that he is one who contemneth the wicked; what little cauſe then have they to think themſelves in a good eſtate, who neither have, nor care to have this property in them? How far ſome are from contemning the wicked, may appeare divers wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By endeavouring what they can to advance the wicked, to advance them (I ſay) to places of honour either in Church or Commonwealth. An ordinary thing it is with men to beſtow their voices and their paines in this kinde upon any, even as they are ſwayed by favour, faction, or the like; never conſidering nor
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52962:88"/> caring what manner of perſons they be whom they ſeek to advance, nor regarding the precept of the Apoſtle, <hi>to do nothing by partiality,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By magnifying the wicked becauſe they flouriſh in the world: therefore people uſually ſpeake of them as if they were the only happie men. Such and ſuch (in their mindes and mouthes) are the beſt in the town or pariſh, becauſe (forſooth) they are the moſt potent, wealthy, &amp;c. whereas it may be being the moſt wicked, they are the worſt. A man is to be prized according to his ſoul, the principal part of him, and that indeed which makes him to be a man:<note place="margin">Cum voles veram hominis eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationem inire, nudum inſpice. Ponat patrimonium, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> ſo much as his ſoul is worth, ſo much indeed is he worth, and not more. Now (as the wiſe-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n tels us) <hi>the ſoul of the wicked</hi> is little worth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. And therefore though their houſe, lands and poſſeſſions are worth much, yet they themſelves are worth little. By what vile and contemptible terms are the wicked ſet forth in the Scripture? They are termed <hi>Droſſe,</hi> Ezek. 22.19. <hi>Chaffe,</hi> Matth. 3.12. <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine,</hi> Matt. 7.6. <hi>Serpents</hi> and <hi>Vipers,</hi> Matth. 23.33. Yea, <hi>Devils,</hi> John 6.70.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By flattering the wicked in their wickedneſs, and extolling them even <hi>eo nomine</hi> becauſe they are wicked. <hi>They ſay ſtill unto them that deſpiſe me, The Lord hath ſaid, Ye ſhall have peace: and they ſay unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evill ſhall come upon you.</hi> So the Lord complaines of falſe Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.17. And <hi>Salomon</hi> tels of ſome <hi>that praiſe the wicked,</hi> Proverb. 28.4. <hi>That ſay to the wicked, Thou art righteous;</hi> but he ſaith, That <hi>the people ſhall curſe him</hi> that doth ſo, <hi>the nations ſhall abhorre him,</hi> Prov. 24.24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By being familiar with the wicked. They that <hi>draw nigh unto</hi> God, (that <hi>acquaint themſelves with him,</hi> Job 22.21. and <hi>delight themſelves in him,</hi> Pſal. 37.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) they <hi>honour God,</hi> Iſai. 29.13.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:52962:88"/>
               <p>So they that draw nigh to the wicked, that acquaint themſelves with them, and delight in them, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the wicked. He that doth contemne the wicked, will ſay with <hi>David, Depart from me, ye wicked: for I will keep the commandments of my God,</hi> Pſal. 119.115. Eſpecially they honour the wicked, who joyne with them in thoſe things that are wicked. <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a good man, was faulty in this; he joyned with wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> in his wicked enterprize againſt <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> God by his Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> having declared his will to the contrary: for this he was taxed by another Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Shouldeſt thou help the ungodly? and love thoſe that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19.2.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By not ſhewing ſuch ſeverity againſt the wicked as is meete. <hi>Eli</hi> is charged with honouring his ſons more then God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29. becauſe <hi>his ſons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.13. If thou doſt not according to thy place and calling ſhew thy ſelf ſevere againſt the wicked, thou art ſo far from comtemning them, that thow ſheweſt thy ſelf to make more account of them then of God. If thou canſt heare thy children, ſervants or others, curſe, ſweare, or do wickedly in any kinde, and yet not put forth that power againſt them which God hath given thee, it appears that thou art a deſpiſer of God, and not of the wicked. See <hi>Davids</hi> profeſſion what he would do in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. verſ 5, 7, 8. And <hi>Nehemia's</hi> practice, what he did, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.7. and 13.11, 17.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place therefore, let us get our hearts into <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>5</label> ſuch a frame and temper as to comtemne the wicked; and as occaſion requires, let us ſhew our contempt of them. To perſwade and provoke us hereunto, let us conſider theſe motives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an argument that we our ſelves are wicked,<note place="margin">Motives to contemne the wicked.</note> if we do not contemne thoſe that are wicked. <hi>They that forſake the law, praiſe the wicked: but ſuch as keepe the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52962:89"/> law, contend with them,</hi> Prov. 28.4. So to aſſociate ourſelves with the wicked, argues that we are like unto them.<note place="margin">Pares cum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus facillimè congregantur.</note> 
                  <hi>Birds of a feather</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>flie together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to contemne the wicked, is a meanes to make us wicked. He that doth not ſo deſpiſe the wicked, as to avoid all unneceſſary familiarity and ſociety with them,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> is like to be infected by them, and to become like unto them. <hi>Be not among wine-bibbers,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) nor among riotous eaters of fleſh,</hi> Prov. 23.20, 21. As if he ſhould ſay, If thou beeſt among them, thou wilt be one of them, thou wilt conforme unto them. <hi>He that walketh with the wiſe,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be wiſe; but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Proverb. 13.20. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the Iſraelites, ſaith, <hi>They did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the nations</hi> (the Canaanites) <hi>concerning whom the Lord commanded them: But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works: And they ſerved their idols, which were a ſnare unto them,</hi> Pſal. 106.34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not to contemne the wicked, is a meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in their wickedneſs; whereas if we ſhew a contempt of them, it may be of force to reclaime them. <hi>As ſnow in ſummer, and as rain in harveſt, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not ſeemly for a fool,</hi> Prov. 26.1. It is a thing very prejudicial and hurtful. <hi>As he that bindeth a ſtone in a ſling, ſo is he that giveth honour to a fool,</hi> Prov. 26.8. So to flatter the wicked, <hi>this doth ſtrengthen the hands of evil doers, that none doth returne from his wickedneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.14. So alſo to aſſociate with the wicked, and to be familiar with them. Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of one that is refr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. How apt are we to contemn thoſe that contemn us, and lightly to eſteeme thoſe that deſpiſe us? And ſhould we not much rather contemne thoſe that contemne God; and lightly eſteeme thoſe that deſpiſe him? Should we not be much more zealous for him then for our ſelves?
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52962:89"/> Our Saviour Chriſt was ſo; <hi>He gave his backe to the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and his cheekes to them that plucked off the haire: he hid not his face from ſhame and ſpitting</hi> Iſai. 50.6. <hi>When he was riviled, he reviled not again; and when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. <hi>He was led as a lambe to the ſlaughter, and as the ſheep before the ſhearer is dumbe, ſo opened not he his mouth,</hi> Iſai. 53.7. But when he ſaw his Father diſhonoured by thoſe that made merchandiſe in his houſe, buying and ſelling in the Temple; then his zeale and indignation againſt them did preſently ſhew it ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 2.13, 14, &amp;c. So <hi>Moſes</hi> in his own cauſe <hi>was the meekeſt man upon earth:</hi> when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> murmured againſt him, he held his peace, as if he had heard nothing, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. But when he ſaw the people diſhonour God by their idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of the golden calf, then <hi>his anger waxed hot, and he caſt the tables out of his hands, and brake them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the mount. And he took the calf which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and ſtrawed it upon the water, and made the children of Iſrael drinke of it.</hi> He made proclamation alſo, ſaying, <hi>Who is on the Lord's ſide? let him come unto me:</hi> and he cauſed about 3000. of the tranſgreſſors to be ſlain, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. verſ. 19, 20, 26, 27, 28. But in contemning the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, divers cautions are to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt take heed of being raſh and haſty to judge others wicked.<note place="margin">Cautions to be obſerved in contemning the wicked.</note> 
                  <hi>Eli</hi> was over-forward to cenſure <hi>Hannah</hi> for being drunke, when ſhe was troubled in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and powred forth her heart before the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. verſ. 13, 14, 15. Better it is in this caſe to erre on the right hand, then on the left: better to judge well of thoſe that deſerve ill, then ill of thoſe that deſerve well. <hi>Some mens ſins go before unto judgment,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They declare their ſins as Sodome, they hide them not,</hi> Iſai. 3.9. Such are to be judged wicked and vile as they are. But <hi>charity thinketh no evil,</hi> 1 Corinth. 13. verſ. 5.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52962:90"/> Where it ſeeth none, it ſuſpecteth none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though any be notoriouſly wicked, yet they are not ſo to be contemned as to be accounted reprobates and caſt-awayes, ſuch as of whom there is no hope. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did not ſo contemne <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> though he ſaw him to be in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity: But he bade him repent of his wickedneſs, and pray God if peradventure the thought of his heart might be forgiven him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. verſ. 22, 23. See alſo 2 Tim. 2.25, 26. and 2 Theſſ. 3.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt beware of contemning others out of a high conceit of our ſelves, like thoſe whom the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> taxeth, <hi>Which ſay, Stand by thy ſelf, come not neare me, I am holier then thou,</hi> Iſai. 65.5. So when our Saviour ſaw ſome, <hi>That truſted in themſelves, that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others,</hi> he propounded the parable of the Phariſee and the Publican, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out of that humour, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9, &amp;c. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and what haſt thou, that thou haſt not received? and if thou haſt received it, why boaſteſt thou, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> 1 Corinth. 4. verſ. 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt not ſo contemne the wicked, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their power and authority, but muſt ſhew them ſuch reſpect as by their place and calling is due unto them. <hi>Give unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſars,</hi> ſaid our Saviour; though <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a man eminently wicked, was then <hi>Ceſar,</hi> or Emperour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Render to all their due</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) honour to whom honour,</hi> Rom. 13.7.

Theſe examples therefore, though they proove that the wicked are to be contemned (to which purpoſe I alledged them before) yet not ſo, but that reſpect is to be ſhewed to Magiſtrates, and men in authority, though they be wicked. So wives, children, and ſervants, muſt not withſtanding the wickedneſs of their husbands, parents and maſters, ſhew all due reſpect unto them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ought not ſo to contemne the wicked, as to refuſe to do them good. See before, Sermon 13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor ſo as to refuſe good from them. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it not unmeet to appeale to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> when that did make for his ſafety, though <hi>Nero,</hi> who was then <hi>Ceſar,</hi> was monſtrouſly wicked, <hi>Act.</hi> 25.11. They are therefore injurious to themſelves, and indeed to God alſo, who ſo contemne wicked Miniſters, as to contemne their miniſtery, and to refuſe to partake of Gods ordinances adminiſtred by them. Thus the people, becauſe of the wickedneſs of the prieſts, the ſons of <hi>Eli, abhorred the Lords offering,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.17. but in this they did tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, verſ. 24. Chriſt required the people to hear the Scribes and Phariſees, notwithſtanding their ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to obſerve all that they did ſay, ſo long as they taught the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Matth. 23.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Neither are the wicked ſo to be contemned, as that we ſhould refuſe to joyne with them in that which is good. So far forth as the Phariſees held the truth, <hi>Paul</hi> held with them, and profeſſed himſelf one of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52962:91"/> them, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.6. And he bids, <hi>Come out from among them, (viz.</hi> the wicked) <hi>ſeparate your ſelves: but how? and touch not the uncleane thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.17. that is, do not joyne with the wicked in that which is evil: but muſt we therefore refraine from that which is good, rather then joyne with the wicked in it? Where doth the Scripture teach this leſſon?</p>
               <p>Now that we may be enabled to contemnne the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</p>

We muſt conſider the odiouſneſs of ſin, and get a thorough hatred of it. <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turne aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi> Then immediately after, <hi>A froward heart ſhall depart from me; I will not know a wicked perſon. Whoſo privily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſlandereth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, him will I cut off; him that hath a high look, and a proud heart, will not I ſuffer.— He that worketh deceit, ſhall not dwell in my houſe; he that telleth lies, ſhall not tarrie in my ſight. I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the land,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 101.3, 4, 5, 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt eſpecially beware of covetouſneſs; for that will make us <hi>to have mens perſons in admiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of advantage,</hi> Jude verſ. 16. This made <hi>Pilate</hi> ſo to honour <hi>Ceſar,</hi> as for feare of him to condemne Chriſt, whom he knew and acknowledged to be innocent. When he heard the Jews ſay, <hi>If thou let this man goe, thou art not Ceſars friend,</hi> fearing to loſe <hi>Ceſars</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was ſo advantagious unto him, preſently he did that which they deſired, though it were againſt his conſcience, <hi>John</hi> 19.12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt labour for true Chriſtian courage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnanimity, that we may not have <hi>the ſpirit of feare,</hi> (baſe, cowardly feare, as the word in the Original doth import) <hi>but of power,</hi>

               <p>THe diſpoſition of a ſaint and citizen of heaven toward the wicked, I have already ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> that he contemneth ſuch; now I am to treat of his diſpoſition toward the godly, and ſuch here it is ſaid that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he honoureth]</hi> To honour, is as much as highly to eſteeme; and to teſtifie that high eſtimation, by ſome outward expreſſion. In 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>Honouring</hi> and <hi>deſpiſing</hi> are oppoſed, and <hi>deſpiſing</hi> and <hi>eſteeming lightly</hi> are uſed as termes equivalent: honouring therefore muſt import as much as eſteeming highly. But this inward eſtimation muſt alſo be outwaadly teſtified and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: <hi>Honour me now, I pray thee</hi> (ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Samuel) before the elders of my people, and before Iſrael,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.30. Honour therefore hath ſomething in it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth appeare, and is ſeene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Them that feare the Lord]</hi> The godly are oft in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcribed by this, that they feare God. <hi>Obadiah feared the Lord greatly,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.3. <hi>Job was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eſchewed evil,</hi> Job 1. verſ. 1. <hi>Cornelius was a devout man, and one that feared God with all his houſe,</hi> Act. 10.2. The feare of God is put for all piety. <hi>Come ye children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 34.11. He that truely feareth God, will both do what God commands, and avoid what God forbids. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean,</hi> that is, it maketh cleane, Pſal. 19.9. The feare of God therefore is uſually made the character of the godly;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52962:92"/> and the want of this feare, the character of the wicked. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes,</hi> Pſal. 36.1. <hi>There is no feare of God before their eyes,</hi> Rom. 3.18.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for the opening of the words; the doctrine which they offer unto our conſideration, is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the propertie of a citizen of heaven and heir of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

                  <hi>to honour the godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make good account of them, and to carrie himſelf reſpectively toward them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Eliſha</hi> honour <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> not becauſe he was great, (for ſo was <hi>Jehoram</hi> alſo, whom yet he did not honour) but becauſe he was godly. <hi>Were it not</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Jehoram) that I regard the preſence of Jehoſhaphat the king of Judah, I would not looke toward thee, nor ſee thee,</hi> 2 King. 3.14. So alſo did <hi>Paul</hi> honour <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> when he was converted unto Chriſt, though in the eye of the world, he was of meane reputation. <hi>I beſeech thee</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Philemon) for my ſon Oneſimus, Philem.</hi> verſ. 10. And verſ. 12. <hi>Thou therefore receive him, that is mine own bowels.</hi> And verſ. 16. <hi>Not now a ſervant, but above a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a brother beloved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is good reaſon why a citizen of heaven doth (as all ſhould) honour the godly.<note place="margin">Reaſons why a citizen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The godly are honourable, they are worthy to be honoured, honour is due unto them. <hi>Hold ſuch in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> (or as the margent reades it, <hi>honour ſuch</hi>) ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> a man of great pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.29. Honour is due, becauſe of excellencie; for it imports (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> noteth) a teſtification of ones excellency.<note place="margin">Honor teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam importat de excellentiâ alicujus. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. 22. quaeſt. 103. art. 1.</hi>
                  </note> Therefore honour primarily belongs unto God, who only is excellent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.13. to wit, with an independent excellencie. But the godly are alſo excellent by participation, with an excellencie derived unto them from God; and therefore a ſecondary and ſubordinate honour doth belong unto them. <hi>David</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken of <hi>the ſaints that are upon the earth,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after calls them <hi>the excellent,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. And
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52962:92"/> 
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> tels us, that <hi>the righteous is more excellent then his neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12.26. And he ſaith, <hi>Better is the poore that walketh in his uprightneſs, then he that is perverſe in his ways, though he be rich,</hi> Prov. 28.6. The godly <hi>are called the pretious ſons of Sion, comparable to fine gold,</hi> Lam. 4.2. They are excellent in reſpect of birth and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <hi>Borne not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> John 1.13. They are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in reſpect of that portion and inheritance which belongs unto them. <hi>If children, then heires, heires of God, and joynt-heires with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>Heires of the kingdome which God hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 2.5. They are excellent in reſpect of thoſe gifts and graces which are in them. They are endowed with wiſdome; for true wiſdome is <hi>the wiſdome of the juſt,</hi> Luke 1.17. And <hi>wiſdome makes a mans face to ſhine,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 8.1. <hi>Wiſdome is the principal thing,</hi> Proverb. 4.7. <hi>She is more pretious then rubies, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto her,</hi> Prov. 3.15. They are endowed with faith, they are <hi>of the houſhold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6.10. And faith is <hi>pretious,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. <hi>More pretious then gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. They are endowed with righteouſneſs and holineſs, and thereby they reſemble God, in that they <hi>put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4 24. Hereby they are made <hi>partakers of the devine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God doth honour the godly. They are pretious in his ſight, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.4. He will honour thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me</hi> (ſaith God, ſpeaking of the godly) <hi>therefore will I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him: I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my Name. He ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him. I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him. With long life will I ſatisfie him, and ſhow him my ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 91.14, 15, 16. Though God be <hi>the God of all fleſh,</hi> Jerem. 32.27. yet eſpecially is he the God of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52962:93"/> the godly. <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God,</hi> Heb. 11.16. Though <hi>the whole world be Gods, and all that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 24.1. yet the godly are his in a ſpecial manner. <hi>But now thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob. and that formed thee, O Iſrael, Feare not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine,</hi> Iſai. 43.1. They are <hi>his citie,</hi> Pſal. 48.8. <hi>His houſe,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. <hi>His heritage,</hi> Joel 2.17. <hi>His temple,</hi> 1 Cor 3.16. <hi>His people,</hi> Iſai. 63.8. <hi>His friends,</hi> Iſai. 41.8. <hi>His chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.18. <hi>His jewels,</hi> Mal. 3.17. <hi>His pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar treaſure,</hi> Pſal. 135.4. Though Gods providence be over all, yet eſpecially over the godly. <hi>He is the Saviour</hi> (or Preſerver) <hi>of all, but eſpecially of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry,</hi> Pſal. 34.15. <hi>He that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye,</hi> Zach. 2.8. <hi>The Lord is good unto all,</hi> (Pſal. 145.9.) but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the godly. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> unto God) <hi>which thou haſt laid up for them that feare thee?</hi> Pſal. 31.19. <hi>He will bleſſe them that feare the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 115.13. <hi>They are the bleſſed of the Lord, which made heaven and earth,</hi> verſ. 15. To them will Chriſt the judge of all, ſay at the laſt day, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit you the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</hi> Matth. 25.34. Yea, God doth ſo honour the godly, as to do good to others for their ſake. <hi>I have learned by experience, that the Lord hath bleſſed me for thy ſake,</hi> ſaid <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 30.27. <hi>It was little that thou hadſt before I came,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Laban) and it is now increaſed to a multitude: and the Lord hath bleſſed thee ſince my coming,</hi> verſ. 30. <hi>The Lord bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Egyptians houſe for Joſephs ſake; and the bleſſing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the houſe, and in the field,</hi> Gen. 39.5. <hi>Lo</hi> (ſaid the Angel unto <hi>Paul) God hath given thee all them that faile with thee,</hi> Act. 27.24. For
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52962:93"/> 
                  <hi>Paul's</hi> ſake God preſerved all that were in the ſhip with him, that notwithſtanding the extreme danger that they were in, yet they all eſcaped.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt doth honour the godly. He calls them his friends; <hi>You are my friends</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if you do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I command you. Henceforth call I you not ſervants: for the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth. but I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you friends: for all things that I have heard of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have I made known unto you,</hi> John 15.14, 15. He calls them his brethren; <hi>He is not aſhamed to call them brethren, ſaying, I will declare thy Name unto my brethren,</hi> Heb. 2.11, 12. See alſo John 20.17. and Matth. 25.40. Yea, when ſome came and told Chriſt that his Mother and brethren were without, deſiring to <hi>ſpeake with him,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>who is my Mother? and who are my brethren? And he ſtretched forth his hand toward his diſciples, and ſaid, Behold my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my brethren.<note place="margin">

               <p>Thus our Saviour preferred his ſpiritual kindred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his carnal kindred. And when a certaine woman having heard his words, cryed out, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked:</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Yea, rather bleſſed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it,</hi> Luke 11.27, 28.

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1.42, and 48. Yet this priviledg would have availed her little, if ſhe had not been one that feared God. <hi>Bleſſed is ſhe that beleeved,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elizabeth</hi> unto her, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.45. That ſhe was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, this was it that did make her bleſſed.

It would have profited her nothing, that ſhe conceived Chriſt in her womb, if ſhe had not conceived him by faith in her heart: her carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt would have done her no good, if ſhe had not had ſpiritual relation to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Angels do honour the godly. Though they be moſt excellent and glorious creatures, yet they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain not to attend on the godly, and to miniſter unto them. When <hi>Jacob</hi> returned out of Meſopotamia, <hi>the angels of God met him, viz.</hi> to guard him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.1. <hi>The angel of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) encampeth round about them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 34.7. This reaſon our Saviour gives, why all ſhould take heed of deſpiſing any of the meaneſt Saints; <hi>For I ſay unto you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>That in heaven their angels do alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in heaven,</hi> Matth. 18.10. He calls the angels <hi>their angels,</hi> becauſe by Gods appointment they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant upon them. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them that ſhall be heires of ſalvation?</hi> Heb. 1.14.</p>

               <p n="5">5. By carping and cavilling at them, however they demeane themſelves. <hi>Whereunto</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>ſhall I liken this generation? It is like unto children ſitting in the market, and calling to their fellowes, and ſaying, We have piped unto you, and you have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking,</hi> (he led an auſtere kinde of life) <hi>and they ſay, He hath a devil. The Son of man came eating and drinking,</hi> (converſing with men after a more familiar manner) <hi>and they ſay, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners,</hi> Matth. 11.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By miſ-interpreting and perverting even their beſt actions. As when our Saviour by the finger of God did caſt out devils, ſome moſt blaſphemouſly ſaid that he did it by Beelzebub, the prince of devils, Mat. 12.24.</p>
               <p>Thus many wayes do ſome ſhew their contempt of the godly, even becauſe they are godly. And eſpecially when the godly (as their duty is) reprove them for their exorbitancies and miſdemeanours, then they ſcorne and deride, raile and revile, calling them preciſe fools, and what not? <hi>This fellow is newly come to ſojourne among us, and he will needes make himſelf a judge;</hi> ſaid the Sodomites of <hi>Lot,</hi> when he went about to diſſwade them from their wickedneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.9.

                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:52962:100"/> ourſelves unto God, by being careful to performe this duty of honouring thoſe that fear God. All the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons pre-alledged, ſhould be ſo many motives to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with us in this behalfe. But further let us conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt hath given a ſtrict charge, ſaying, <hi>Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones,</hi> Matt. 18.10. How dangerous it is to deſpiſe the godly, he hath alſo ſhewed us, ſaying, <hi>Whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhall offend one of theſe little ones, which beleeve in me, it were better for him that a mileſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea,</hi> verſ. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The honour or diſhonour done unto the godly, redounds to the honour or diſhonour of God himſelf. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the Iſraelites, when they murmured againſt him and <hi>Aaron, Your murmurings are not againſt us, but againſt the Lord,</hi> Exod. 16.8. So may it be ſaid of all that deſpiſe the godly, Their deſpiſing is not a deſpiſing of men, but of God. <hi>He that deſpiſeth</hi> (any in whom doth appear and ſhine forth the ſanctifying grace of Gods Spirit) <hi>deſpiſeth not man, but God;</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.8. <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Inaſmuch as ye have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me. I was an hungred, and ye gave no meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me,</hi> Matth. 25.35, — 45.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To honour the godly, becauſe they are godly, is a ſure ſigne of a gracious heart; and to deſpiſe the godly as ſuch, argues a moſt graceleſſe Spirit. <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth alſo him that is begotten of him,</hi> 1 John 5.1. <hi>If a man ſay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen? And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, ſhould love his brother alſo,</hi> 1 John 4. verſ. 20, 21. <hi>This is the meſſage, which ye heard from the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52962:100"/> beginning, that we ſhould love one another. Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and ſlew his brother: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſlew he him? becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.11, 12. <hi>We know, that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren,</hi> verſ. 14. There is a love, <hi>viz. a love of good will,</hi> which we owe unto all: but <hi>the love of friendſhip and familiarity,</hi> this we owe peculiarly to the godly: thus to love them, is to delight in them; and that (as hath been ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is one thing, wherein doth conſiſt the honour that is due unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The godly are rare, few in compariſon, <hi>a little flocke,</hi> Luke 12.32. Therefore they are the more to be eſteemed. <hi>Rara cara,</hi> Things that are rare, as pearles and pretious ſtones, are much ſet by, and highly prized. <hi>The word of the Lord was pretious in thoſe dayes, there was no open viſion,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.1. Becauſe it was rare, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was pretious; though ſome by <hi>pretious</hi> do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>rare,</hi> and ſo interpret it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To honour the godly is a meanes to encourage them,<note place="margin">

                     <gap reason="foreign">

Indeed ſuch as are truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will be content to paſſe thorough <hi>honour and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.8. Yet this will afford ſome encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement even to the beſt, if they be reſpected and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as it meet. When the Chriſtians came to meet <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was going to <hi>Rome,</hi> aſſoone as he ſaw them, <hi>he thanked God, and took courage,</hi> Act. 28.15. On the other ſide, the godly themſelves are ſometimes troubled at thoſe affronts and indignities that are done unto them. <hi>The word of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremie) was made a reproach unto me, and a deriſion daily. Then I ſaid, I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his Name: but his word was in my heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing,</hi> Jer. 20.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The godly are profitable to others; meanes to prevent evil, and procure good, not only in reſpect
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52962:101"/> of themſelves, but alſo in reſpect of others, as was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.27. and 39.5. and <hi>Act.</hi> 27.24. See alſo 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.14. &amp;c. Therefore ſuch as do not honour the godly, are injurious not only to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo to themſelves. While <hi>Lot</hi> was in Sodome, it could not be deſtroyed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. Had not the Sodomites then reaſon to have reſpected <hi>Lot</hi> otherwiſe then they did?</p>
               <p n="7">7. God hath ſhewed himſelf much provoked againſt thoſe that have ſhewed themſelves deſpiſers of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Becauſe <hi>Mical</hi> deſpiſed <hi>David,</hi> when ſhe ſaw him dance before the Arke, and ſcoffed at him for it, <hi>Therefore ſhe had no child unto the day of her death,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.23. So God cauſed two ſhee-beares to teare in pieces two and forty children, becauſe they mocked and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 King. 2.23, 24.</p>

                  </gap>onouring the godly, that ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be accounted godly; or for ſome other by-end, and baſe reſpect. The Scribes and Phariſees would build the tombes of the Prophets, and garniſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the righteous; as if they had been moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to obſerve the admonitions of the Prophets, and to follow the examples of the righteous; when as indeed it was quite contrary: therefore our Saviour inveighs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and cryes woe unto them for their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.29. <hi>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, ſhall receive a prophets reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous mans reward,</hi> Matth. 10.41. It is not enough to honour a prophet, or a righteous man, but it muſt be done, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> in that very reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a prophet, or a righteous man; and then, not otherwiſe, is a reward to be expected. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give you a cup of water to drinke in my name,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>becauſe you belong to Chriſt, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward,</hi> Mark 9.41. The leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhewed to the godly, becauſe they are godly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a true and unfained love of piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall not be unrewarded: on the other ſide, the greateſt honour done to the godly, if it be not done in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, it is worth nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt honour the godly without pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ialitie. The godly muſt be honoured as godly; and therefore all that are godly muſt be honoured, as well one as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As well the godly that are members of the Church militant here below, as they that are members of the Church triumphant in heaven. The Scribes and Phariſees ſhewed much reverence and reſpect to the prophets and righteous men, that were dead, building their tombs, and garniſhing their ſepulchres, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.29. but they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52962:102"/> deſpiſed and abuſed moſt ſhamefully ſuch as were among them, as appeared by their deportment toward <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and towards Chriſt himſelf. So the Papiſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Saints departed more then enough; but the Saints that are upon earth they ſcorne and contemne, yea hate and perſecute. But <hi>David</hi> was not thus partial; his goodneſs did extend to the Saints that were upon the earth; thoſe he accounted excellent, and in them was all his delight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. Certaine it is, He that doth not regard the Saints that are here upon earth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhew he make of honouring the Saints in heaven, all is but falſe and fained. For as S. <hi>John</hi> argueth, <hi>He that loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> 1 John 4.20. So he that honoureth not the Saints here, whom he hath ſeen, how can he honour the Saints in heaven, whom he hath not ſeen?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As well the godly that are poore and of meane condition in the world, as thoſe that are rich, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in any wordly reſpect. This is that which S. <hi>James</hi> preſcribeth, ſaying, <hi>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of glory, with reſpect of perſons,</hi> Jam. 2.1. For this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Galatians, that they did honour him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that poore and deſpicable condition (as to the eye of the world) which they ſaw him in. <hi>And my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which was in my fleſh, ye deſpiſed not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Gal. 4.14. In this reſpect alſo he commended <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſhew mercy unto the houſe of Oneſiphorus, for he oft refreſhed me, and was not aſhamed of my chaine.</hi> (Though <hi>Paul</hi> were a priſoner, and in bonds, yet <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> ſhewed all love and reſpect unto him:) <hi>But when he was at Rome, he ſought me out very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and found me,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.16, 17. <hi>Be not thou therefore</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Timothy) aſhamed of the teſtimonie of our Lord, nor of me his priſoner,</hi> verſ. 8. Thus did <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:52962:102"/> himſelf honour <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> a poore ſervant, and a fugitive too, but now a convert. He makes honourable mention of him, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.9. <hi>With Oneſimus a faithful and beloved brother.</hi> And the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> was writen meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his behalf.

               <p>Though ſwearing only be expreſſed in the Text, yet it is not ſo to be underſtood, as if promiſes made without an oath were not to be regarded, or needed not to be performed.

He mentioned indeed only the creatures, there being ſpecial reaſon for it, as I may ſhew more hereafter; but he did not therefore allow ſwearing by God; no, the reaſons annexed make againſt this. For Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth to ſweare by the creatures, becauſe of that refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which they have unto God; therefore ſwearing by God directly and immediately, is here much more forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Neither will that expoſition conſiſt with thoſe words, verſ. 37. <hi>But let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay,</hi> &amp;c. which words do as well forbid ſwearing by God as by the creatures: and ſo alſo do thoſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Nor by any other oath.</hi> Some therefore thinke all ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever ſimply and abſolutely forbidden.

Hieron. ad Mat. 5.34.</hi>
                  </note> that as it was permitted unto the Jews to offer ſacrifices unto God, that ſo they might not offer them unto idols: ſo they were permitted to ſweare by God; not that they did well in ſo doing, but becauſe it was better to give that honour to God then to devils. But now the Goſpel (he ſaith) doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any oath at all. In like manner doth <hi>Theophylact</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, as hath been noted before; but this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation alſo hath been before confuted, it having been proved both by example, and by reaſon, that both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Chriſt an oath was, and alſo ſince his coming is lawful.

                  </gap> it might be uſed, but ſo as that it is not lawful to ſweare either falſly, or raſhly, to wit, when there is no juſt occaſion for it. Chriſt did bend
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52962:111"/> his ſpeech againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, who held, that if they did not uſe ſome certaine formes of ſwearing, it was no matter how they did ſweare. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.16, 18. Therefore Chriſt ſhewes all formes of ſwearing to be unlawful, to wit, when there is no juſt cauſe of ſwearing. Again, the Scribes and Phariſees thought, that if they did not ſweare falſly, all was well enough, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33. Therefore Chriſt forbids as well raſh, as falſe ſwearing;<note place="margin">Summa huc redit, aliis modis fruſtrà accipi Dei nomen quam perjurio. <hi>Calvin. ad Mat. 5.</hi>

This infirmity of another they take to be that evil ſpoken of, when it is ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever is more then theſe (viz.</hi> yea, yea; and nay, nay) cometh of evil. And therefore they obſerve, that it is not ſaid, Whatſoever is more, is evil; but, cometh of evil, to wit, the infirmity of him, who compells a man to ſweare, becauſe otherwiſe he will not beleeve him. But this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I cannot embrace; for ſurely Chriſt ſpeakes of the evil of him that ſweareth, and not of him who is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion why he ſweareth. For this evil is alledged as the reaſon why ſwearing ſhould be avoided: but the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men, in not beleeving without an oath, is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why to avoide an oath, but why to uſe it. <hi>Calvin</hi> takes this to be the meaning, that ſwearing doth ariſe from the corruption that is in men,<note place="margin">Calvin. ad loc.</note> who are ſo falſe and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52962:112"/> deceitful, that except they ſweare, it is hard to truſt them. But the purport of Chriſts words (I think) is not to ſhew whence ſwearing doth proceed, but ſo as withal to ſhew what the nature of it is, to wit, evil; not ſimply and in all caſes whatſoever, but when there is no ſufficient cauſe for it. Thus therefore are the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be underſtood: Whatſoever is more then yea and nay, that is, whatſoever is affirmed or denied not barely, but with an oath, when there is no good And juſt occaſion for it, cometh of evil, that is, of mens corruption, who take Gods name in vain by their raſh and unadviſed ſwearing.</p>

So <hi>Paul</hi> uſed to ſweare by God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>and</hi> 11.31. Thus the Angels ſweare, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.5, 6. So God <hi>having no greater to ſweare by, doth ſweare by himſelf,</hi> Heb. 6.13. <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworne, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. 22.16.

               <p>There is great reaſon why we ſhould only ſweare by God; becauſe he, by whom we ſweare, muſt be omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient and omnipotent; he muſt know the heart and thoughts, and be able to take vengeance on him that ſweareth falſly; elſe an oath were in vain, it could not be for confirmation of what is ſpoken, and to end all ſtrife among men;<note place="margin">Quid eſt jurare, niſi ejus quem testaris fidei tuae praeſulem, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam potentiam confiteri? <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. lib. 5. epiſt. 30.</hi>

The Apoſtle reckoneth this among the great. and haynous ſinnes of the heathens, that they were <hi>covenant-breakers,</hi> Rom. 1.31. Therefore it being a dutie to performe promiſe and covenant, and a ſin to breake it? a citizen of heaven will, as every one ought,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52962:116"/> not breake, but performe; and that though ſome way or other he ſuffer by it, ſin being rather to be avoided then ſuffering, and iniquity rather then affliction, <hi>Job</hi> 36.21.</p>
               <p>The ſame may alſo be further confirmed by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is true and faithful; therefore they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto God will be ſo alſo. <hi>Be ye followers of God as deare children,</hi> Epheſ. 5.1. <hi>As he who hath called you is holy, be ye alſo holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. If in all manner of converſation, then in this, in performing promiſes, and keeping covenants; for in this God is holy. <hi>He is faithful that hath promiſed,</hi> Heb. 10 23. <hi>He is a faithful God that keepeth covenant,</hi> Deut. 7.9. Neh. 1.5. <hi>He hath remembred his covenant for ever,</hi> Pſal. 105.8. And ſo he will remember it; <hi>He will ever be mindful of his covenant,</hi> Pſal. 111.5. <hi>My covenant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I not breake,</hi> Pſal. 89.34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faithfulneſs is one of the great and weighty things of the law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. By <hi>faith</hi> there, is meant fidelity, as the Geneva-Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth expreſſe it,<note place="margin">Fidem] i. e. dictorum &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventorum conſtantiam ac verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. — Hic Chriſtus agit duntaxat de mutuis hominum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſe officiis. <hi>Beza ad Matth.</hi> 23.23.</note> that is, a care to deale ſincerely, and to be ſtedfaſt in keeping covenant. For (as <hi>Beza</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) our Saviour there doth treat only of ſuch duties as men do mutually owe one to another.</p>
               <p>But 2. oathes more eſpecially ought to be performed, and ſo will be by thoſe that feare God, what ever preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice they ſuſtain by it. He that feareth God, is alſo one <hi>that feareth an oath,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.2. He feareth to take an oath unadviſedly; and having taken an oath, it containing nothing but what is lawful, he feareth to breake it. He that ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord, and ſtand in his holy place, is one <hi>that doth not lift up his minde to vanity, nor ſweare deceitfully,</hi> Pſal. 24.4. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and the princes of Iſrael having ſworne to the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52962:116"/> though in taking that oath they were not ſo well adviſed as they ſhould have been, yet having taken it, and the matter of it being juſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſpare and preſerve the Gibeonites who did yeeld up themſelves unto them, they would keepe it. <hi>And the children of Iſrael ſmote them not, becauſe the princes of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ſworne unto them by the Lord God of Iſrael: And all the congregation murmured againſt the princes. But all the princes ſaid unto all the congregation, We have ſworne unto them by the Lord God of Iſrael: now therefore we may not touch them,</hi> Joſh. 9.18, 19. So <hi>David</hi> having ſworne to <hi>Shimei</hi> that he ſhould not die, <hi>viz.</hi> for revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him as he had done, he kept his oath, and let <hi>ſhimei</hi> live while he himſelf lived, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.23. and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.8. He gave <hi>Salomon</hi> indeed an <hi>item</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Shimei,</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> at length put him to death; but it was for a new offence whereby he made himſelf guiltie of death, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.36, &amp;c. <hi>Zedekiah's</hi> ſin in not keeping covenant with the king of Babylon is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by this, that he had confirmed the covenant by oath, and yet did breake it. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, ſurely in the place where the king dwelleth, that made him king, whoſe oath he deſpiſed, and whoſe covenant he brake, even with him in the midſt of Babylon ſhall he die,</hi> Ezek. 17.16. <hi>Seeing he deſpiſed the oath by breaking the covenant (when lo he had given his hand) and hath done all theſe things, he ſhall not eſcape. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, As I live, Surely mine oath that he hath deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompence upon his own head,</hi> Ezek. 17.18, 19.</p>
               <p>There is great reaſon why ſpecial regard ſhould be had of oathes, and ſpecial care of performing them.</p>
               <p>For 1. An oath is a moſt ſolemne and ſacred bond, <hi>an oath for confirmation being unto men an end of all ſtrife,</hi> Heb. 6.16. What is confirmed by oath,<note place="margin">See Heb. 6.17, 18.</note> men make themſelves ſure of, and doubt not of the performance of what is ſo promiſed. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> would have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52962:117"/> his ſervants to ſweare, when he ſent him about a wife for his ſon <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 24 3. And <hi>Jacob</hi> requiring his ſon <hi>Joſeph</hi> to bury him when he was dead, not in Egypt, but in Canaan, he would not reſt in his promiſe except he took an oath for the confirming of it; and that being done, he was ſatisfied, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.29, 30, 31. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is a ſin to breake a ſimple promiſe, ſo much more a promiſe made with an oath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As all ſin whatſoever redounds to the diſhonour of God, and therefore any hurt or hinderance ſhould rather be indured then any ſin be committed; ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſweare falſly and deceitfully, to promiſe by oath and not to performe, this (I ſay) eſpecially doth diſhonour God, his Name being called on, and he being made a witneſs of that which is ſo promiſed, and a judge to avenge the non-performance of it. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſweare by my Name falſly; neither ſhalt thou profane the Name of thy God: I am the Lord,</hi> Levit. 19.12. This is a moſt haynous profaning of Gods Name, a moſt fearful deſpiſing of his Majeſty. Therefore the princes of Iſrael durſt not but keepe covenant with the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and performe what they had promiſed, becauſe they had ſworne unto them by the Lord. <hi>We have ſworn unto them</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>by the Lord God of Iſrael; now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not touch them,</hi> Joſ. 9.19. They knew and conſidered, that it would be a great diſhonour unto God, and cauſe his Name to be blaſphemed by aliens and adverſaries, if they themſelves did ſo profane it, as not to regard what they had ſworne by it. <hi>Surely, mine oath that he hath deſpiſed, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompence upon his own head,</hi> ſaid God concerning <hi>Zedekiah, Ezek.</hi> 17.18. In the verſe next but one before, it is called the king of Babylons oath <hi>(whoſe oath he deſpiſed)</hi> becauſe <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſwore to him; but here God calls it his oath, because <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſwore by him, and therefore God would be avenged on him for doing him ſuch diſhonour, as to take ſuch an
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52962:117"/> oath, and when he had done to deſpiſe it; this was even to deſpiſe God himſelf. This may ſuffice to prove, that covenants and promiſes, eſpecially if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by oathes, ought to be performed, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the performing of them turne to a mans hurt and prejudice; becauſe not to performe them is ſin, great and grievous ſin: and as all ought, ſo they that feare God will rather eſchew the evil of ſin, then eſcape the evil of affliction; the evil of ſin being the greater evil, it is rather to be avoided then the other.</p>

                  <hi>Calvin</hi> therefore upon the place in <hi>Joſua</hi> doth well obſerve,<note place="margin">Jurisjurandi religio couſque ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta apud nos eſſe debet, ut ne erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris pretextu à pactis diſcedamus, etiam in quibus fuimus decepti, &amp;c. <hi>Calvin. in Joſ. 9.</hi>
                  </note> that an oath ought to be of ſuch force with us, that we ought not to violate it even in thoſe things wherein we have been deceived. Indeed he thinketh that the oath which they ſware to the Gibeonites was not obligatorie, for that (as he ſuppoſeth) the Iſraelites had no power to contract in that kinde with the Canaanites, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commanded them to deſtroy them, and to make no covenant with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2. But it is ſtrange, that both <hi>Joſua</hi> and the reſt of the princes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhould hold themſelves bound by that oath, and God alſo ſhould many years after puniſh the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, if it were of no force, but was unlawful in reſpect of the very matter of it. Therefore I rather ſubſcribe to thoſe, who hold that the Iſraelites were not ſimply forbidden to covenant with the Canaanites, and to ſpare their lives, but only while they continued in their idolatrie; otherwiſe if they did renounce that, they might be covenanted with and preſerved. In thoſe places of Scripture, where the people of Iſrael are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to covenant with the Canaanites, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to deſtroy them, the reaſon is ſtill given, Leſt otherwiſe the Canaanites ſhould inſnare the Iſraelites, and draw them to be idolatrous like themſelves, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.12, 13, 14, 15. and 23.32, 33.</p>
               <p>Now there was no feare of this danger, when the Canaanites did forſake their idolatry, and embrace the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52962:119"/> true religion; in which caſe therefore (ſo farre as I can ſee) it was lawfull for the Iſraelites to covenant with them, and not to deſtroy them though they had power to do it; this alſo being further added, that the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites were to yeeld up themſelves and all that they had unto the Iſraelites, God having given thoſe nations and their poſſeſſions unto his people. That in <hi>Joſ.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Iſrael, ſave the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon, all other they tooke in battel. For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they ſhould come againſt Iſrael in battel, that he might deſtroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour,</hi> &amp;c. That (I ſay) doth intimate, that if their hearts had not been ſo hardened, but that they had ſought peace as the Gibeonites did, the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour might have been ſhewed unto them, which was ſhewed unto the other. And we read that in the time of <hi>Salomon</hi> there were many of the Canaanites remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whom yet <hi>Salomon</hi> did not deſtroy, but only made them more tributary, and exacted more ſervice of them then of others, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.20, 21.</p>
               <p>Again, for force and violence, neither doth it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige a man from performing what he hath promiſed, eſpecially if he have ſworne to doe it. As, if a robber by the high way force a man, threatning otherwiſe to kill him, to ſweare that he will give him ſo much by ſuch a time; a man having thus ſworne, though he were fored to it,<note place="margin">Calvin. in Pſal. 15.</note> yet is bound to performe. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſeemes to be againſt this, becauſe a robber is <hi>publicus hoſtis,</hi> a common enemy. But others better reſolve it thus, that it being lawful for one to redeeme his life with the loſſe of money,<note place="margin">Ameſ. in Pſal. 15.</note> and this being no prejudice to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, one having ſworne thus to a robber, he ought to performe it. But (ſay they) if beſides the payment of money, one ſweare to conceale the matter, except there were ſure hope that the thief would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger follow that courſe, this part of the oath were not to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52962:119"/> be kept, becauſe it were as much as to betray the ſafety of others, who might alſo fall into the theeves hands.</p>

                  </note> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that in an oath there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold obligation; one to man, to whom a thing is promiſed; and this (he ſaith) is taken away by coaction; becauſe he that offers violence, thereby makes himſelf unworthy that a promiſe made unto him ſhould be performed. But there is another obligation, whereby one is bound unto God, to performe that which he hath promiſed by his name. And this obligation notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding coaction is of force, becauſe a man ſhould rather ſuffer a temporal loſſe, then break his oath. After this manner alſo, do ſome others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But whereas they ſeeme to make only an oath valid and obligatorie, although it were extorted by force, I ſee not but that it is ſo alſo in reſpect of a promiſe wich is made without an oath. For though he ſin that doth offer violence, and ſo is unworthy that one ſhould performe that promiſe that was made unto him; yet that is not enough to make it no ſin in him that doth break his promiſe; neither ſhould we ſo looke at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unjuſt violence, as therefore not to ſhew our ſelves faithful. And as they ſay, <hi>Magis debet quis dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num temporale ſuſtinere, quam juramentum violare,</hi> One ſhould rather ſuſtaine ſome temporal loſſe, then violate his oath: ſo (I think) it may be ſaid, <hi>Magis debet quis damnum temporale ſuſtinere, quam fidem violare,</hi> One ſhould rather ſuſtaine ſome temporal loſſe, then breake his word, and prove himſelf unfaithful.</p>
               <p>But concerning the binding force of oathes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, there are ſome limitations and qualifications to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:52962:120"/>1. If a promiſe be made, though with an oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, it doth not binde, except the condition whereupon it was made,<note place="margin">Limitations and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding force of oathes and promiſes.</note> be performed. In this ſenſe we reade of Gods breaking his convenant, and not performing his promiſe, to wit, becauſe the promiſe 2was conditional; and ſo the condition failing, of no force, as no promiſe at all. See <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.10. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.34. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.9, 10. If therefore two covenant together, and ſweare each to other, to doe ſo and ſo, but each of them upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the other performe his part; the one failing, the other is not bound any longer. But if two parties ſweare mutually, yet not conditionately, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely each to performe his part, in this caſe they are both abſolutely bound, and the failing of one party doth not diſ-ingage the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a promiſe be made by ſuch as are not <hi>ſui compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This muſt be underſtood of ſuch children and fooles, ſuch mad and drunken perſons, as are quite voide of the uſe of reaſon, and are utterly unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they promiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ſuch as are not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> in their own power, but under the power of others, without whoſe conſent they cannot diſpoſe of themſelves, nor of any thing that they have, if ſuch (I ſay) promiſe, and ſweare to do this or that, it is not binding, except the oath or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be ratified by thoſe that have power over them. God would not have a vow made unto himſelf by a child under age, or by a wife, to be of force, except the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the husband did confirme it. See <hi>Num.</hi> 30. verſ. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It is a wrong to a ſuperiour, that ſuch as are under him do any thing againſt his minde, and without his conſent, it being ſuch a thing as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52962:120"/> they are dependent upon him, and owe ſubjection to him: and a promiſe or an oath cannot binde one to that, whereby he ſhall become injurious unto another. By this rule alſo it appears, that if one have firſt ingaged himſelf by oath or promiſe, and afterward promiſe and ſweare that which is croſſe and contradictorie, this latter oath and promiſe is not valid, becauſe here a man is not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> not free, being pre-ingaged. The firſt oath or promiſe, being lawful, muſt ſtand; and the latter, being inconſiſtent with it, is unlawful, and doth not binde. The laſt will and teſtament indeed doth binde, and the former is null; becauſe a will and teſtament is of no force while a man liveth; there muſt firſt be the death of the teſtatour, before the teſtament can be of force, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.17. But it is otherwiſe in reſpect of oathes and promiſes, which are of force aſſoon as they are made: the latter oath or promiſe doth not diſanul the former, but the former doth make voide the latter, when they are repugnant one to the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If he to whom a promiſe is made, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by oath, grant a releaſe, in this caſe one is free and diſ-ingaged; he is not faithleſs and perjured if he do not performe; for the other releaſing him, it is as if either he had not promiſed, or had performed. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is ſaid to have offered up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Heb. 11.17. Jam. 2.21. becauſe as much as in him lay he did it: he was willing and ready to doe it, and had done it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but that God who firſt to try him did command it, afterward, having ſufficiently tried him, did forbid it. So may a man be ſaid to performe his promiſe, when as for his part he is ready to performe it, but that he to whom he made the promiſe, doth acquit him. <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi> It is no wrong to him to whom a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, not to performe it, if he himſelf be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that it ſhould not be performed. But this muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſo far forth as it concernes him to whom the promiſe is made; it muſt not redound to the injurie of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52962:121"/> another. Every man may remit his own right, it being meerly poſitive; but one cannot remit the right of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other without his conſent. <hi>Abraham</hi> would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was the king of Sodome's: though by the right of war all was his; yet he would have others that were confederate with him to have their parts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. verſ. 21, 22, 23, 24. Hence it is determined by the learned,<note place="margin">Sanderſ. de Juram.</note> that two being contracted together, cannor by mutual conſent break the promiſe which they have made; becauſe it concernes not only their own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, which they may diſpence with, but alſo Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which is not to be diſpenced with by them: and therefore it would be injurious unto God to break that contract. The releaſing which is of force to make a promiſe of no effect, is when the promiſe that is made, doth only concerne the benefit of him to whom it is made, who therefore hath power to releaſe him that made it.</p>

Though <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> had the Emperours ſafe-conduct, yet becauſe they were hereticks, as the Fathers of that Councel would have them, therefore they decreed, that the promiſe made unto them was not to be performed, but that they were to be proceeded againſt as hereticks; and ſo they cauſed them to be burnt.

               <p>Some perhaps intend at the preſent the performance of what they ſweare, or promiſe; but afterwards, either through inconſtancy and lightneſs, or becauſe of ſome inconvenience that they are like to meet with, they fall off, and will not performe.

               <p>Now to this end, that we may performe our Oathes, and our promiſes, let us obſerve theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we promiſe, and eſpecially ſwear, let us be ſure to underſtand what we doe. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth,</hi> (ſaith Solomon) <hi>and let not thine heart be haſty to utter a thing before God.</hi> Eccleſ. 5.2.

                  </note> Let us therefore (I ſay) be well adviſed, before we ingage our ſelves by promiſe, eſpecially, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the promiſe by an Oath. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſervant was very cautious in taking the Oath which his maſter required of him; he was very careful to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

If we doubt of the lawfulneſs of the Oath or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which is required of us, we may not meddle with it; for though in it ſelf it be lawful, yet to us it is not lawful. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own minde.</hi> Rom. 14.5. <hi>I know and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf: but to him that eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi> ver. 14. <hi>And he that doubteth, is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith; for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</hi> ver. 23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we judge the oath or promiſe lawful, and not to be refuſed, let us deal ſincerely, and intend what we ſwear or promiſe.

               <p n="4">4. After we have ſworn, or promiſed, let us be mindful of our Oaths and promiſes, and careful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them. <hi>David</hi> thought of the covenant that he made with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and the Oath which he ſware unto him; when <hi>Jonathan</hi> was dead, he remembred it, and had a care to perform it. <hi>Is there yet any</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that is left of the houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew him kindneſs for Jonathans ſake?</hi> 2 Sam. 9.1.

And to this end again, that we may obſerve the forementioned directions, we muſt obſerve theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt get and increaſe, act and exerciſe faith.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52962:126"/> If we have faith in God, it will inable us to keep faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, whatſoever come of it. <hi>For by it</hi> (by faith) <hi>the Elders obtained a good report.</hi> Heb. 11.2. <hi>Through faith they wrought righteouſneſs.</hi> ver. 33. <hi>Faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> ver. 1. By faith <hi>we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith will make us <hi>to have a good conſcience in all things, and to be willing to live honeſtly.</hi> (Heb. 13.18.) though in outward and earthly reſpects it prove never ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and hurtful unto us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt nouriſh and maintain in us the fear of God; for then we will <hi>fear an Oath,</hi> ſo as not to take it, if it be unlawful; nor to break it, if it be lawful, and we have taken it. Becauſe people are poſſeſſed with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fear, and want this ſpiritual fear; becauſe they have more of the fear of man then of God in them, therefore againſt their conſcience they promiſe and ſwear any thing that is impoſed upon them; and they make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any promiſes or Oathes to perform them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſanctifie the Lord of hoſts himſelf, &amp; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he ſhall be for a ſanctuary.</hi> Iſa. 8.13, 14. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that have no more that they can do. But I will tell you whom you ſhall fear; fear him, who when he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> Luk. 12.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt pray and labour for Chriſtian fortitude and courage, to be <hi>valiant for the truth:</hi> for want of which grace, <hi>Jeremy</hi> complained of thoſe of his time. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5. <hi>God hath not given us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the ſpirit of fear</hi> (baſe, cowardly fear, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>but of power, and of love, and of a ſound minde.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. If we have this ſpirit, we ſhall be able to <hi>hold both faith and a good conſcience,</hi> as he exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to doe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19.<note place="margin">Qui dicit hominem mentiri, eâdem operâ dicit cum adverſus Deum audacem eſſe, adverſus hominem timidum.

                  <hi>A liar</hi> (ſaith a learned man) <hi>is bold againſt God, but fearful and faint-hearted towards men.</hi> So more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52962:127"/> is he that makes no conſcience of an Oath, but will take it, though it be not lawful; and will not keep it when he hath taken it, though it be lawful. But here ſelf-confidence muſt be taken heed of; <hi>Be ſtrong, yea, be ſtrong,</hi> as the angel ſaid to <hi>Daniel. Dan.</hi> 10.19. But as the Apoſtle doth admoniſh, <hi>Be ſtrong</hi> (not in your ſelves, but) <hi>in the Lord, and in the power</hi> (not of your own, but) <hi>of his might.</hi> Epheſ. 6.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, We muſt wean our hearts from the world, and <hi>ſet our affections on things above.</hi> Col. 3.2. and <hi>lay up our treaſure in heaven.</hi> Mat. 6.20. This will ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us both to refuſe unlawful Oathes and promiſes, and alſo to keep thoſe that are lawful, though in worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it prove to our hurt.</p>

                  <hi>ticto,</hi> which is, <hi>to bring forth,</hi> becauſe uſury makes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to bring forth money. So in Latine the word for uſury is <hi>foenus,</hi> becauſe it is (ſay ſome) <hi>quaſi foetus,</hi> as the brood of money. The Latine word alſo for uſury is, <hi>uſura,</hi> whence we have our Engliſh word <hi>uſury.</hi> The word <hi>uſura</hi> doth generally ſignifie the uſe of any thing;<note place="margin">Natura nobis dedit uſuram vitae. <hi>Cic.</hi>
                  </note> but it is appropriated to ſignifie the uſe of money, the lending of it for gain and advantage. Neither is there uſury of money only, but alſo of other things, to wit, ſuch as are ſpent and conſumed in the uſe of them, as
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52962:128"/> corne, wine, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 23.19. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.37. uſury of money and uſury of victuals are joyned together, as being of one and the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Now for the thing it ſelf, which we call uſury, it is,<note place="margin">What Uſury is.</note> a mutuation or lending for gain.</p>

                  </note> The Scripture ſpeaking of uſury, ſpeaks alſo of lending upon uſury, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19, 20. Now this mutuation or lending, by which uſury is defined, is, 1. Of things which are ſpent and conſumed in the uſe of them, as of money, and ſo of any thing that we eat or drinke. Thus <hi>mutuation</hi> differs from <hi>commodation,</hi> which is lending too, but of things which are not ſpent and conſumed in the uſe of them, as of an horſe, or an houſe, or the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore this mutuation or lending, in which uſury doth conſiſt, is an alienation, both of the uſe, and alſo of the propriety of that which is lent; whereas in that lending which is called <hi>commodation,</hi> it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: there is an alienation of the uſe of a thing ſo lent, but not an alienation of the propriety of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore alſo in this lending called <hi>mutuation,</hi> the borrower is not to reſtore the ſame individual thing which was lent, as the very ſame money, or the very ſame corn or wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the ſame in kinde and in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Whereas in that lending which is called <hi>commoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the ſame individual thing which was lent, as the ſame horſe, or houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be reſtored.</p>

For if beſides that which was lent, ſomething be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recompence of ſome damage which the lender did
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52962:129"/> ſuſtaine for want of his money, when he would and ſhould have had it, but could not get it, this properly is no uſury; which is onely when one purpoſely doth lend for gaine, either expreſly covenanting for it, or at leaſt, having in his minde an intention and expectation of gaine, ſo that he would not lend, but that he lookes to have his own againe with ſomething alſo for the loane of it. And therefore alſo if one lend freely, and the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower having gained, beſtow a gratuity on the lender, this is no uſury: becauſe the lender did neither cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for, nor intend any gaine to himſelfe; onely he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that which is freely given him; freely, I ſay, in that he neither could exact, nor did expect any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew what is meant by uſury, when we ſpeake of the unlawfulneſs of it. And that ſuch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury is unlawful, appears as by the text in hand, ſo alſo by many other places of Scripture. As <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. <hi>If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou ſhalt not be to him as an uſurer, neither ſhalt thou lay upon him uſury.</hi> So <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.35, 36, 37. <hi>If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou ſhalt relieve him; yea, though he be a ſtranger, or a ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he may live with thee.

Neither is it true in it ſelf, that the prohibition of uſury did onely concerne the Jewes. For here in the text <hi>David</hi> makes the avoyding of uſury the property of every one whoever he be that ſhall abide in Gods taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and dwell in his holy hill; ſo that it concerns us as much as it did the Jewes.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons to prove uſury unlawful.</note>The reaſons which argue uſury to be unlawful, may be reduced to theſe two heads, <hi>viz.</hi> the impiety, and the iniquity of it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52962:131"/>1. There is impiety in uſury. For piety requires us to take ſuch courſes, as to know and acknowledge our dependence upon God, and ſo to pray unto him for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in that which we take in hand, and to give him thanks when our undertakings are ſucceſsful. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths,</hi> Prov. 3.5, 6. <hi>Eſtabliſh thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands eſtabliſh thou it.</hi> Pſal. 90.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi> Deut. 8.18. But the uſurer, as an uſurer, takes ſuch a courſe as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (ſo much as in him lies) to have no dependence upon God. Whereas the husbandman in his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depends upon God for the former and the later raine, and for temperate ſeaſons: merchant and ſeafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man, for good windes, and calm ſeas; the artificer, Lawyer, Divine, and generally all, for health and ſtrength to follow their vocation: it's all one to the uſurer whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fair or foul, calme or tempeſtuous; yea, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his uſury, it's all one to him, whether he be ſtrong or weak, in health or in ſickneſs; except the Sun and the Moon ſtand ſtill, and the courſe of the monthes and years be ſtaid, his gain ſtill comes in, whatſoever happen. How then can the uſurer, as ſuch, look up unto God, and acknowledge him? How can he either pray, that he may proſper in the courſe which he takes, or give thanks if he doe proſper in it? Surely uſurers are of the number of thoſe that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, ſaying, <hi>They ſay unto God, Depart from us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nullum genus hominum pejus de Deo ſentit, quam daniſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>

But the uſurer makes one pay for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſo much for ſo much, and ſomething alſo for the uſe of it, and that is indeed for nothing, I mean, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinct from the money. For in money the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and the uſe (except perhaps it be uſed onely for ſhew and oſtentation) cannot be ſevered, no more then in bread, or any thing that is eaten or drunken; becauſe the uſing of money, as of bread, or the like, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of it; ſo that to make a man pay ſo much money as was lent him, and ſomething alſo for the uſe of the money, is as if one ſhould make one pay for meat and drinke as much as it is worth, and ſomething moreover for the eating and drinking of it. Therefore the uſury of money, and the uſury of victuals are both alike for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, as being both alike unlawful. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is alſo agreeable to equity, That two contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, one ſhould be liable to hazard as well as the other. But in uſurious contracts the lender is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to no hazard: let the borrower ſink or ſwim, gaine or loſe, the uſurer will be ſure to gaine, he will have his own with advantage. Now this is unequal and unjuſt, that one ſhould be eaſed, and another burthened. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Thus both Scripture and reaſon doe ſufficiently evince that uſury is unlawful; but many things are objected in defence of it.</p>

Some expound it thus, Lend hoping for nothing againe more then was lent, lend ſo as to look for no uſury: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuppoſe the meaning of thoſe words to be, that we ſhould ſo lend, as not to hope for the principal againe, not to expect ſo much as was lent, to wit, if the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               <p>I Have ſhewed what uſury properly ſo called is, and have both by Scripture and by reaſon proved it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

                  </label> But, 1. I anſwer as before, <hi>There is no neceſſity of ſinning, but the onely neceſſity is of not ſinning.</hi> 2. There is no queſtion but that many trade, and thrive by their trading, without either lending or borrowing upon uſury; and therefore there is no ſuch neceſſity of it, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. 3. If ſome cannot drive ſo great a trade as they do, without uſury; ſuch trading is not neceſſary, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is uſury neceſſary for the ſupporting of it. If it be ſaid, that they cannot maintain themſelves and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations without ſuch trading; it may be anſwered, that perhaps they cannot in that manner as they doe: but there is no neceſſity that they ſhould ſo doe it. They may carry a lower ſayl, live in a meaner faſhion; and ſo they ſhould do, rather then venture upon unwarrantable courſes. <hi>They that will be rich,</hi> (ſo they that will be great and pompous in the world; that take up this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52962:136"/> that whatever come of it, they will be ſuch) <hi>fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and many fooliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts, which drown men in perdition and deſtruction.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.9. 4. Though lending and borrowing be neceſſary, yet uſury is not neceſſary, further then mens corrupt mindes, their covetous and hard hearts do make it neceſſary.</p>
               <p>It is objected againe, That it is lawful to borrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>10</label> uſury, and therefore alſo it is lawful to lend upon u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.</p>
               <p>Some thinke both lending and borrowing in this kinde to be unlawful: ſome thinke them both lawful; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> and ſome thinke the one no more unlawful then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that they muſt be both lawful, or both unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For my part, if both muſt needs be of like nature, and either ſtand or fall together, I ſee not, but that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing upon uſury muſt rather be condemned, then lending upon uſury ſhall be allowed. But (for any thing I yet ſee) there is not the like reaſon of both; but the one may be lawful, and the other unlawful. As it may be lawful for one to accept of an oath from him that ſweareth by falſe gods, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did from <hi>Laban, Gen.</hi> 31. yet it is a ſin to ſwear in that manner: ſo it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for one to borrow money of him that will not lend but upon uſury; and yet it is a ſin to lend in that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this reſpect he ſaith, <hi>And it ſhall be as with the people, ſo with the Prieſt; as with the ſervant, ſo with his maſter; as with the maid, ſo with her miſtreſs; as with the buyer, ſo with the ſeller; as with the lender, ſo with the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower; as with the taker of uſury, ſo with the giver of uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto him.</hi> So that the Prophet <hi>Jeremie,</hi> Jer. 15.10. <hi>I have neither le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> Beſides, the Hebrew word uſed in thoſe places of <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Jeremie,</hi> is another word, and not that which is commonly uſed for uſury. Some obſerve, that the word doth not properly import lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon uſury, but to lend upon ſecurity, ſo as to exact what was lent, though no more. Which ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is not unlawful though in ſome caſes it may be ſo; and however, it may cauſe contention. And this is that which the Prophet ſheweth he was careful to avoyd: his words neither make for the lawfulneſs of lending, nor againſt the lawfulneſs of borrowing upon uſury. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theſe two of like nature: for he that borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon uſury, being inforced to it, becauſe he hath urgent occaſion to borrow, and cannot borrow freely, he (I ſay) doth but ſuffer injury, which is his ſorrow, but not his ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Even as one that is conſtrained to pay an unreaſonable rent for an houſe, or ground, becauſe he cannot otherwiſe ſhift for the preſent, or to yeeld to any hard bargaine for the avoyding of ſome greater inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; he being but a meer patient, is guiltleſs, though the agent be guilty. For the oppreſſour ſinneth, but the party oppreſſed doth onely ſuffer, he ſinneth not. If it be ſaid, That he that borroweth upon uſury doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion another to lend upon uſury, and therefore if the lender ſin, ſo doth the borrower alſo: The anſwer is, that the borrower upon uſury is not actively an occaſion of anothers lending upon uſury, but paſſively onely. For though he pay uſury, and ingage to pay it, yet it is, becauſe he muſt either ſuffer that or a greater evil. A man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the hands of robbers, for fear of loſing his life, with his own hands gives them his money; yet is not he acceſſary to their ſin that take it. If a man in his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity bring for a pawn or pledge that which he cannot wel
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52962:137"/> ſubſiſt without, he being neceſſitated to it, ſinneth not; but he doth ſin, that doth take it. God in ſuch caſes threatneth to puniſh the oppreſſour, but promiſeth to ſuccour and relieve the oppreſſed. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26, 27.</p>
               <p>Some object and ſay, that the law of the land doth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>11</label> allow uſury; and therefore (they conclude) it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>But, 1. If the law of the land did allow uſury, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> yet that could not warrant the practiſe of it in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. It is Gods law, and not mans, by which we muſt be judged at the laſt day. <hi>There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy,</hi> Jam. 4.12.

                  </note> another thing to allow. The law of the land doth ſet bounds to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and ſtint them, that they ſhall undergoe the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they tranſgreſs and goe beyond the bounds that are ſet them: yet doth it not allow any u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury at all, though it be within the bounds that are ſet; onely it ſo far tolerates and permits it, as not to appoint a penalty for thoſe that practiſe it. This doth no more juſtifie uſury, then the judicial law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did juſtifie bills of divorce, which it ſuffered onely for the hardneſs of mens hearts; ſo that ſuch divorce was not puniſhable by man, yet was it evil and ſinful in the fight of God. That which Magiſtrates, who have the Legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſee that they cannot reſtraine without ſome great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inconvenience, that they may tolerate, and onely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the practiſe of it: yet the thing in it ſelf, and in point of conſcience, for all that toleration, is never a whit the more lawful.</p>

                  </note> That the borrower gain as much or more by the money which he borrowed, as the lender. This was the judgment of this famous man, who yet ſeemed more favorable towards uſury then almoſt any had been before him. So <hi>Zanchy,</hi> another learned writer, ſeems to ſpeake in defence of uſury: but how? After all, he comes to this concluſion, that the lender ought to be ſo affected,<note place="margin">Imò hoc animo eſſe debes, O credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ut ſi debitur non ſolum non fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit lucrum, ſed etiam accepit dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, tu quoque damni aliquid cum illo patiaris. Hoc enim poſtulat aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas &amp; charitas. <hi>Zanch.</hi> in <hi>Epheſ. 4.28. de uſurâ quaeſt. 4.</hi>
                  </note> as if the borrower doe not onely not gaine, but loſe by the imployment of the money which he borrowed, to bear ſome part of the loſs with him: for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52962:139"/> that equity and charity require this. Now what kinde of uſury is this, which is here maintained? Truly, It is no uſury at all properly ſo called, but it is a contract of another nature, even meer partnerſhip; wherein both parties, the lender and the borrower, ſhall either gaine together, or loſe together. Who will call this putting forth money to uſury, and not rather putting forth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to adventure? So our countrey-man Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> ſeems to defend ſome kinde of uſury as lawful,<note place="margin">Dr. Willet on Exod. <hi>22.25.</hi>
                  </note> but directly ſo as the author before mentioned. <hi>This conſideration</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>given for the loane of money, muſt not be</hi> ex pacto, <hi>it muſt not be agreed upon by any certaine compact and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. — It is not lawful to covenant with a man to pay ſo much:</hi> (Why ſo?) <hi>He may loſe by uſing the money, he may be in hazard alſo of the principal. For the lender then to receive a certain gain, when the borrower is in a certain loſs, were not juſt. Such indifferencie muſt be uſed, as that the lender be contented as to be made partaker of the gaine, that cometh by his money, ſo alſo proportionably to bear part of the loſs.</hi> Others alſo might be alledged pleading for uſury after the like manner. But theſe are ſuch patrons of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, as (I preſume) no uſurer in the world, not he that is moſt moderate in that kinde, will thanke for his labour; except in this reſpect, that by this meanes (ſeeing what kinde of uſury it is, that his greateſt advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates plead for) he comes to ſee the unreaſonableneſs of that courſe which he followeth; and ſo conſidering his wayes, doth turn his feet into Gods Teſtimonies.</p>

               <p>THat uſury is unlawful, and therefore to be avoyded of all that deſire to live with God, and to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Kingdome, I have proved, and have alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered many (and I thinke, all the chief) objections that are made in defence of it: now I proceed to the uſe and application of the point.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>1</label> And firſt, Here is much matter of reproof; for how few are there that make conſcience of refrayning from uſury? Such as make conſcience of other things, yet take liberty in this, and practice uſury as freely, as if there were no unlawfulneſs at all in it. But a thing is not therefore lawful, becauſe we perhaps to judge of it. Our ſin indeed is the greater, if we practice that, which we know to be unlawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet our erronious opinion of a thing, doth not make it lawful for us to practice it. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſin in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and blaſpheming was extenuated, becauſe he did it ignorantly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. He had ſinned more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly if he had done it againſt the conviction of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; this would have much aggravated his ſin, and have made him the more inexcuſable: yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he ſinned in that which he did: and ſo doe they, who practiſe uſury, though they ſuppoſe it to be lawful.</p>
               <p>That which is in it ſelf lawful, through our error and miſunderſtanding may become unlawful unto us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14, 23. But that which is in it ſelf unlawful, cannot
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52962:140"/> ſo become lawful unto us. For error may marre that which is good, but it cannot amend that which is evil. But again, ignorance doth no whit at all excuſe, if it be affected; if we may know, and have no minde to it, but are <hi>willingly ignorant,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. So alſo the ſin is not the leſs, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if the habituated cuſtome of ſinning take away the ſenſe of ſin, and make it to be thought no ſin. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle aggravates the ſin of the Gentiles by this, That <hi>being paſt feeling, they gave up themſelves to laſciviouſneſs, to commit all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> Epheſ. 4.19.<note place="margin">Caeſar Commen. Plut. in <hi>Lycur.</hi>
                  </note> It is ſaid of the ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that theft was ſo common among them, and they were ſo accuſtomed unto it, that they did not think it to be unlawful. So by the ſame means it is, that ſome can ſee no unlawfulneſs in uſury: but this doth make it nothing the more lawful; it is indeed an aggravation of the ſin, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then an extenuation of it.</p>
               <p>Some give themſelves up to the practice of uſury, never conſidering, nor indeed caring whether it be lawful or unlawful; this ſufficeth them, they finde it gainful. Theſe are ſuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>They ſuppoſe that gaine is godlineſs.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.5. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>s with contentment is great gaine,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>Riches</hi> (ſaith Salomon) <hi>availe not in the day of wrath; but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs delivereth from death,</hi> Prov. 11.4. A little with righteouſneſs is better then a great deale with iniquity. Some ſcorne and deride whatſoever is ſpoken againſt the lawfulneſs of that which they practice; like the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, who hearing our Saviour ſpeaking againſt covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>they being covetous, derided him.</hi> Luke 16.14. Thus it is ſaid of an uſurer, that when he heard one, who had ſome dependence upon him, preach againſt uſury, in a way of deriſion, he applauded him for it, and bid him preach ſo ſtill, that others being deterred from trading in that kinde, he might have the more cuſtome. Thus (as <hi>Salomon</hi> obſerves) <hi>Fools make a mock of ſin.</hi> Pro. 14.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52962:141"/> 9. But (as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> doth admoniſh) <hi>Be ye no mockers, leſt your bonds be made ſtrong.</hi> Eſa. 28.22.</p>
               <p>Some are a little touched perhaps and moved with what they hear againſt uſury, but they will not be throughly perſwaded of the unlawfulneſs of it. As <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> was almoſt perſwaded to be a Chriſtian, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.28. So they are almoſt perſwaded to leave their uſury: but as <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſtill continued an unbeleeving Jew, ſo they ſtill continue unreformed uſurers.</p>
               <p>Some being convinced by what they hear of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of uſury, relent, and promiſe reformation; but by and by being tempted with the ſweetneſs of gain, they practice the thing ſtill as much as ever. Theſe are like <hi>Saul,</hi> who by <hi>Davids</hi> words and carriage towards him, was convinced of his ſin in perſecuting him, and promiſed to deſiſt, and to do ſo no more; yet when the good mood was over, he perſecuted him again, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 24.16. <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> 65.21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with 27.4. But <hi>it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, then after they have known it, to turne from the holy commandment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.21.</p>
               <p>Some being aſhamed (it may ſeem) of open and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect uſury, palliate and cloake it under ſome other name, as <hi>conſideration, intereſt,</hi> and the like; or under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſome other contract, as <hi>buying, ſelling, letting, exchange, &amp;c. Calvin</hi> ſaith of the <hi>French,</hi> and it may be ſaid of others, That they deviſed a new ſubtilty,<note place="margin">Excogitarunt novam aſtutiam, quaſi poſſent Deum fallere. Nam quia nemo poterat ferre uſurae nomen, poſuerunt intereſſe. Jam quid ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat intereſſe? omne genus foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris. <hi>Calv. ad Ezech. 18.</hi>
                  </note> as if they could deceive God. For becauſe the name of uſury was odious among all, therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Uſury</hi> they would ſay <hi>intereſt:</hi> but this intereſt was nothing elſe but all kinde of uſury. <hi>Woe unto them that ſeeke deep to hide their counſels from the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Iſai. 29.15. And though the contract properly be not uſurious, yet if it he unequal and unjuſt, that is enough to make
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52962:141"/> it evil and unlawful.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>2</label> let all have a care to eſchew this ſin of uſury as well as any other.

Now uſury both in Scripture, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writings, is generally condemned, ſcarce any daring to maintain the lawfulneſs of uſury truly and properly ſo called.

An Uſurer was ſo odious, that none would ſalute him, nor ſpeake to him in the ſtreets; his houſe was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the houſe of Satan, and it was held unlawful for a Chriſtian to fetch fire at it. So infamous a thing hath uſury ever beene, that the greateſt uſurers have ever been aſhamed to profeſs themſelves uſurers. Whereas ſome profeſs themſelves merchants, ſome lawyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who is there that will profeſs himſelf an uſurer? the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of uſury appears in this, That ſuch as practice the thing, yet decline the name, and therefore they cloake and hide it one way or other. If the thing be lawful,<note place="margin">Si licitum eſt, cur vocabulum refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis? cur velamen obtexis?

                  </note> Why doe they ſhun the word? Why doe they ſeeke to cover it? If it be unlawful, why do they not eſchew it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The very heathens by the light of nature have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and judged uſury unlawful. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Arist. Pol. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>10.</hi> &amp; Ethic. lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>

Quid homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom occidere?</note> making a thief onely to reſtore dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but an uſurer fourfold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any be not ſo fully convinced of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of uſury, yet the ſafer courſe is to be followed, and that is to avoyd uſury. It's good to keep on the ſafer ſide. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes: but he that hardneth his heart, ſhall fall into miſchief,</hi> Prov. 28.14. Better it is to fear where we need not, then to make bold where we ſhould not. We may ſin in putting forth money to uſury; we cannot ſin in refraining from uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: therefore this is more ſafe, and rather to be choſen then the other.</p>
               <p>For the avoyding of uſury, let theſe directions be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.<note place="margin">Directions to be obſerved for the avoyding of uſury.</note> 1. Take heed of rebelling againſt the light, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith ſome doe. <hi>Job</hi> 24.13. <hi>To him that knoweth to doe good,</hi> (ſaith St. James) <hi>and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> Jam. 4.17. to him eſpecially. If you know uſury to be evil, you know that it is good to abſtaine from it; and then if you doe not, your ſin is the greater.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of turning from the light, of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from hearing and meditating of that which may diſcover the unlawfulneſs of uſury unto you. It argues the heart to be in love with ſin, and unwilling to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, if it be unwilling to be convinced of it. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God,</hi> Joh. 3.19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of adventuring upon uſury, as if it were lawful becauſe of the commonneſs of it. If a thing be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52962:142"/> grown common, it is ſoon taken to be lawful. But that is a moſt unſafe rule to walk by.<note place="margin">Caepit licitum eſſe, quod pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum eſt. <hi>Cypr.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> Exod. 23.2. It may be evil though a great multitude doe it, and therefore we muſt take heed of preſuming that a thing is good and lawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe generally people practice it: indeed in that reſpect it is the more to be ſuſpected. <hi>For wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be that goe in thereat,</hi> Mat. 7.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be not allured and drawn away with uſury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the gainfulneſs of it. <hi>A little that a righteous man hath, is better then the riches of many wicked,</hi> Pſal. 37.16. <hi>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, then great treaſure and trouble therewith,</hi> trouble of conſcience, which ſin will bring at the laſt. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Wo unto him that increaſeth that which is not his: How long?</hi> Hab. 2.6. <hi>He that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his dayes, and at his end ſhall be a fool,</hi> Jer. 17.11.</p>
               <p>But another inference from the Doctrine is this, That <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>3</label> if uſury be unlawful, then reſtitution ought to be made of that which is gotten by uſury. None can have a juſt right to that which he hath unjuſtly gotten: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having no juſt right to it, he ought not to keep it, but to reſtore it. <hi>Then it ſhall be, becauſe he hath ſinned, and is guilty, that he ſhall reſtore that which he violently tooke away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten,</hi> &amp;c. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 6.4. <hi>If the wicked reſtore the pledge, give again that he hath robbed,</hi> &amp;c. Eze. 33.15. <hi>Zacheus</hi> profeſſed himſelf ready to reſtore fourfold, if he had taken any thing from any man unjuſtly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.8. This reſtitution ought to be made to thoſe of whom the gain was unjuſtly gotten, or to their heirs: or if that cannot be, ſo much ſhould be given to pious uſes. I know this will ſeeme harſh to many, and we may preach it long, but few will practice it. Yet howſoever, we muſt declare the truth, though few or none will regard it. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeake my
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52962:143"/> words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</hi> ſaith God to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ezek. 2.7. And again, <hi>When I ſay unto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die, and thou giveſt him not warning, nor ſpeakeſt to warne the wicked from his wicked way to ſave his life; the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickedneſs, nor from his wicked way, he ſhall die in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy ſoul.</hi> Ezek. 3.18, 19. So alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.8. the ſame words are repeated. <hi>Wherefore I take you to record this day,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to ſome among whom he had preached) <hi>that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not ſhunned to declare unto you the whole counſel of God,</hi> Act. 20.26, 27.</p>

But that place cannot be meant of ſuch a gift: for the rich doe not uſe to fear the wrath of the poor, ſo as for the pacifying of it to beſtow gifts upon them. It may ſeem therefore to be meant of the juſt anger and indignation of Magiſtrates, or others, who according to their place and calling ſhould endeavour to have ſin and wickedneſs puniſhed; but being bribed and corrupted with gifts, they connive at it, and let it goe unpuniſhed.

                  <hi>Shochad,</hi> is commonly taken for an unjuſt gift or reward, and is certainly ſo taken in the ſenſe, becauſe it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward againſt the innocent.</p>

But ſome may be innocent in reſpect of that which they are charged with, or puniſhed for by men, ſo as not to deſerve ſuch dealing at their hands. Thus it is ſaid, That the wicked <hi>in ſecret places doth murther the innocent,</hi> Pſal. 10.8.

Now whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Nor taketh reward againſt the innocent,</hi> that is, to the prejudice &amp; hurt of the innocent, it is not ſo to be underſtood, as if it were always lawful to take a reward for the innocent. It is not lawful for a Judge or Magiſtrate to take a reward to that end, that he may defend the innocent, and doe him ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

And (ſaith he) if he will not take a reward in the behalf of the innocent for the clearing of his innocency, how much leſs will he take a reward againſt the innocent for the perverting of judgment? And (as <hi>Calvin</hi> notes upon the place) although this chiefly concern Judges and Magiſtrates, yet it reacheth further, even to private perſons, who may be corrupted with rewards to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize and help forward evil cauſes, as to betray the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and to deliver him up into the hands of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, as <hi>Delilah</hi> dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Judg. 16.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> with Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.14, 15, 16, 47, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to plead againſt the innocent, to make his cauſe ſeem naught when it is good, as <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor did againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 24.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or to bear falſe witneſs againſt the innocent, as ſome did againſt <hi>Naboth,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.13. and ſo againſt our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.60, 61. It is not ſaid indeed, that either theſe, or the other received any gifts and rewards for their falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but it is moſt probable that they did, and uſually witneſſes are corrupted by that means. Neither indeed is it expreſſed, that <hi>Tertullus</hi> was hired to plead againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> yet there is little doubt of it, he being an Orator, as he is called, and Orators not uſing to plead for nought. But however, ſuch as for any of theſe ends, or if there be any other of like nature, take a reward againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, they are ſuch, as <hi>David</hi> in the Text ſhewes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whom he ſpeaketh, to be moſt unlike unto, for he taketh not a reward againſt the innocent.</p>

               <p>Salvation is not ſimply and abſolutely common unto all, as was obſerved from thoſe words v. 1. <hi>Who ſhall?</hi> Yet in this ſence it is common unto all; <hi>He that doth theſe things;</hi> not ſome that do them, but all, whoever they be, ſhall be ſaved. Thus Salvation may be called <hi>Common Salvation,</hi> as <hi>S. Jude</hi> calls it in his Epiſtle, verſ. 3.</p>
               <p>The promiſes of life and of ſalvation in this ſence are univerſall, and belong unto all. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3.16. <hi>Glory, honour and peace to every man that worketh good,</hi> Rom. 2.10. <hi>In every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him,</hi> Act. 10.35.</p>
               <p>The ground and reaſon of this commonneſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is Gods impartiality; he is no reſpecter of perſons: and therefore none ſhall be excluded from Salvation that are meet to partake of it. This Reaſon is given by <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 10.34, 35. <hi>Of a truth I perceive, that God is no reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of perſons: But in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi> And ſo by <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2.10, 11. <hi>Glory, honour and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo the Gentile: for there is no reſpect of perſons with God.</hi> True it is, God from all Eternity did chuſe whom he pleaſed, and refuſe whom he pleaſed. <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.13. <hi>You,</hi> paſſing by many others, whom he might as well have choſen, if it had pleaſed him. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. God gave ſome unto Chriſt, to be his, and to be ſaved by him, and not others. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many a thou haſt given him.</hi> John 17 2. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>I pray for
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52962:150"/> them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me; for they are thine.</hi> Verſ 9. And ſo God gave Chriſt for ſome, and not for others, that is, with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute purpoſe to ſave ſome, and not others. <hi>And for their ſakes! ſanctifie my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 17.19. <hi>For thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and tongue, and people, and nation,</hi> Rev. 5.9. So in time God calls and converts ſome, as he pleaſeth, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> Rom. 9.18. Yet in theſe things properly God is no reſpecter of perſons: For he looks not at any thing in the perſon whom he chuſeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth, ſo as therefore to chuſe and convert him, but he doth it meerly of himſelf, of his own good Will and Pleaſure. <hi>It is your Fathers pleaſure to give you the kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. <hi>Even ſo, O Father; for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight,</hi> Mat. 11.26. Men may beſtow Gifts and Benefits upon ſome, and not upon others, and yet not be guilty of reſpect of perſons: Becauſe they are not obliged either to the one or to the other, but their acts are acts of Grace and Favour. Much more may God beſtow his Gifts and Benefits on whom he pleaſeth, he being much more free in his diſpenſations then any man whatſoever. To him eſpecially it appertaines to ſay, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do with mine own as I will?</hi> Mat. 20.15. He is debtor to none, further then by his own free purpoſe and promiſe he hath made himſelf a debtor. <hi>For who hath given unto him firſt, and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again?</hi> Rom. 11.35. But God hath determined to beſtow Salvation upon men in a judicial way, and by way of reward; not as a reward merited, but as a reward freely beſtowed on thoſe that are ſo qualified as God requires them to be that ſhall obtain it. <hi>God will bring every work to judgment,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.14. <hi>He hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſs,</hi> Act 17.31. <hi>He will render to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.6. <hi>Knowing that of the Lord yee ſhall receive the reward of the Inheritance,</hi> Col.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52962:151"/> 3.24 Salvation and eternal life is <hi>an inheritance,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto children, ſuch as are adopted of God in Chriſt, Rom. 8.16, 17. And yet it is alſo a <hi>reward,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſtowed on thoſe that work and labour for it, though their work and labour is far ſhort of deſerving it. <hi>To him that ſoweth</hi> (that is, worketh) <hi>righteouſneſs, ſhall be a ſure reward,</hi> Prov. 11.18. Now here God is cleerly no reſpecter of perſons, becauſe he judgeth impartially, and diſtributeth to every one that reward which is agreeable to his work. <hi>He will render to every man according to his deeds. To them, who by patient contiouance in well doing ſeek for glory and honour, and immortality, eternal life. But to them that are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, indignation and wrath,</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7, 8. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.

Neither is profeſſion ſufficient. <hi>They profeſs that they know God, but in their works they deny him, being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and diſobedient, and to every good worke reprobate,</hi> Tit. 1.16. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name? and in thy Name have caſt out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Mat. 7.21.22, 23. <hi>Then ſhall ye begin to ſay, We have eaten and drunken in thy preſence and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets.

                  <hi>God will render to every one according to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.6. but not to every one for his deeds.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52962:154"/> to their deeds, not for their deeds, not for the merit of them; becauſe they do not deſerve ſalvation. For, 1. The beſt works that any can do, are due; and therefore not meritorious. <hi>When ye ſhall have done all theſe things, which are commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; We have done that which was our duty to do,</hi> Luk. 17.10. Secondly, If we do any good, we do it not of our ſelves, by our own power, but it is God that doth inable us to do it. <hi>For we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but all our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. Therefore whatever good we do, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to God, and not he to us for it; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we cannot merit any thing at his hands by it. Thirdly, Our good works are mixed with evil works, and are in themſelves, even the beſt of them, imperfect. <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3.2. There is iniquity even in our holy things, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. Therefore <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> though he prayed unto God to remember him concerning the good that he had done, yet to ſhew how far he was from preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the merit of it, he added, <hi>And ſpare me, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy,</hi> Neh. 13.22. Fourthly, There is no proportion betwixt our works and Salvation; no works that we can do are equal to it;<note place="margin">Illi namque beatae vitae, in quâ cum Deo, &amp; de D o vivitur, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus poteſt aequari labor, nulla o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera comparari, preſertim cum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolus dicat, non ſunt condigne paſſiones hujus temporis ad fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam gloriàm, quae revelabitur in nobis. <hi>Gregor. ubi ſupra.</hi>

For this end God ſent his Son to redeem us, <hi>that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might ſerve him without fear, in righteouſneſs and holineſs before him all the days of our life,</hi> Luke 1.74, 75. For this end Chriſt gave himſelf for us. <hi>He died for all, that they which live, might not live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5 15. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14 There is no hope of Salvation by Chriſt, without yielding obedience unto Chriſt. <hi>He is the author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9.

As for ſuch as will not ſubject themſelves unto Chriſt, and be ruled by him, they are his enemies, and muſt look for nothing but deſtruction from him. <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies which would not ſuffer me to reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me,</hi> Luk. 19.27.</p>
               <p>This likewiſe makes for the Conviction of thoſe that <label type="milestone">

On the other ſide, the evil converſation of Profeſſors doth much diſhonour God. <hi>Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law, through break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, diſhonoureſt thou God? for the Name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles, through you,</hi> Rom 3.23, 24.

               <p n="2">2. And as it is for the glory of God, that we be doers of his will, ſo is it for our own good. <hi>The wicked work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a deceitful work, but to him that ſoweth righteouſneſs, ſhall be a ſure reward,</hi> Prov. 11.18.

               <p>The reaſon of this Doctrine is cleer and evident. It muſt be obedience that God will accept and reward. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to obey is better then ſacrifice: and to hearken, then the fat of rams,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.22. Chriſt is <hi>the author of eternal ſalvation, to all that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. Now to obey, is to do that which is commanded; yea, and to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is commanded. Though a man do never ſo much, yet if he do not thoſe things that are commanded, and becauſe they are commanded, it is no obedience. To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Lord, is to obey his voice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. it is to do what he injoyneth, and becauſe of his injunction. Chriſt was <hi>obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.8. For it was the will of his Father, that he ſhould ſuffer death, even that death: and becauſe it was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, therefore he did it. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelfe: I have power to lay it down; and I have power to take it again: this commandment have I received of my Father,</hi> Joh. 10.17, 18.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> This firſt ſhews the vanity of the Romiſh Religion, which teacheth people to do many things as parts of Gods Worſhip and Service, which yet God hath no where
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52962:158"/> in his word required of them. They are things of mens deviſing, and not of Gods preſcribing; and therefore they are ſo far from being profitable, that they are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial; it being ſuperſtition and idolatry to worſhip and ſerve God with other Worſhip and ſervice then he himſelf doth appoint. <hi>In vain</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,</hi> Mark 7.7.</p>
               <p>This alſo diſcovers the folly of ſome among our ſelves, who do this or that, but neither know, nor regard what warrant they have from Gods word for it.</p>
               <p>Some reſt meerly in the example of their fore-Fathers: their Fathers before them did ſo and ſo, and therefore they alſo will do ſo. This was the plea that the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> uſed; <hi>Our Fathers</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>worſhipped in this mountain,</hi> Joh. 4 20. But (ſaid our Saviour to her) <hi>You worſhip ye know not what,</hi> verſ. 22. It is not the Example of our Forefathers, but the word of God, that muſt be the Rule of our practice. <hi>Be ye not as your fathers,</hi> Zach. 1.4. Further then they conformed unto God, we muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto them.</p>
               <p>Some look no further then the cuſtom of the times and places wherein they live. Others generally do ſuch and ſuch things: and therefore they alſo will do them. Thus the Meſſenger that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſent unto <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſought to prevail with him, ſaying, <hi>Behold now, the words of the Prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth, let thy word I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</hi> But <hi>Micaiah</hi> anſwered well, ſaying, <hi>As the Lord liveth, what the Lord ſaith unto me, that will I ſpeak,</hi> 1 King. 22.13, 14. So this was <hi>Joſhua's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you</hi> (ſaid he to the people of <hi>Iſrael) to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but as for me, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24.15.</p>
               <p>Some are apt to think, that if their Superiours, and ſuch as are in authority over them, enjoyn any thing, it's a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52962:159"/> warrant ſufficient for them to do it. But this was the ſin and the undoing of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that is, the ten Tribes, of which <hi>Ephraim</hi> was the chief, and therefore is put for all. <hi>Ephraim is oppreſſed and broken in judgment; becauſe he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly walked after the commandment,</hi> Hoſ. 5.11. To wit, the commandment of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> (as R. <hi>David Kimchi</hi> doth well expound it) who ſet up the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>

                     </gap>. Kimchi ad <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 15.11.</note> and commanded the people to worſhip them, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.28, 29. See alſo <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Ye are bought with a price;</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be ye not the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. Not ſo the ſervants of men, as to forget that both you and they are Gods ſervants: and therefore not ſo the ſervants of men, as ſimply and abſolutely to do what they injoyn, but ſo far forth as it is not repugnant to Gods injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Children, obey your parents, in the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 6.1. So muſt ſervants obey their maſters, and Subjects their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates <hi>in the Lord,</hi> that is, ſo as in obeying them to obey the Lord; and therefore not in any thing which the Lord doth not allow. It was a worthy reſolution of thoſe three Jews, who when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> threatened to caſt them into the fiery Furnace, if they would not fall down and worſhip the golden Image which he ſet up, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; <hi>O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter. If it be ſo, our God whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee O king, that we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip thy golden Image which thou haſt ſet up,</hi> Dan. 3.16, 17, 18. So <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being commanded by the Jewiſh Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, not to ſpeak at all, nor teach in the Name of Jeſus, anſwered, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you more then unto God, judge ye,</hi> Act. 4.19. And when theſe and the reſt of the Apoſtles were asked why they had done contrary to this command, they made this anſwer, <hi>We ought to obey God rather then men,</hi> Act. 5.29.

               </p>
               <p>Finally, ſome content themſelves with this, that though they have no ground or warrant from the Word of God for what they do, yet they have a good minde, and mean well; and therefore they think God will accept what they do, and reward them for it. But though an ill intention may marr a good action, yet a good intention cannot amend an ill action. <hi>Uzzah</hi>'s good meaning in putting forth his hand to ſtay the Ark, could not ſecure him from Gods wrath; becauſe the action in it ſelf was not good, being not agreeable to Gods Word, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.9, 10. with 15.13.</p>
               <p>But again, If Gods Word muſt be the Rule of mens <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> doings, then muſt Miniſters take heed what they preach; it muſt not be any of their own or other mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the will of God revealed in his Word. Miniſters ought to preach, what people ought to practice. <hi>For the Priests lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth; for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts. Mal.</hi> 2.7. And though people ought onely to practize what Miniſters ought to preach, yet they are apt to practize what the other do preach, whether it be right or wrong; and much rather if it be wrong, then if it be right. <hi>The Prophets propheſie falſly, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo.</hi> Jer. 5.31. <hi>And I have ſeen folly in the Prophets of Samaria; they prophecyed in Baal, and cauſed my people to erre.

               </p>
               <p>Not that any can fully and perfectly obſerve and do all that God commandeth: <hi>for in many things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all,</hi> Jam. 3.2. But that a reſpect muſt be had to all that is commanded, as well in one point as in another: there muſt be a care and an endeavor to perform all; we muſt not wave any thing that God requires of us, but muſt have reſpect to all his commandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6.</p>
               <p>Now that ſaving obedience is in this ſence not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, but univerſal, may appear by theſe arguments:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Saints and Servants of God, whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are recorded and ſet forth for imitation, were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perform ſuch obedience. <hi>Abraham</hi> was willing and ready to obey God in whatſoever he did require of him. When God commanded him to leave his
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52962:162"/> Country and his Fathers houſe, though this might ſeem both unpleaſing and unprofitable, yet he did it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. When God commanded him to be circumciſed, though it were both ſhameful and painful, he ſubmitted unto it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. When God commanded him to ſend away his Son <hi>Iſmael,</hi> though when <hi>Sarah</hi> ſpake to him about it, the thing ſeemed very grievous unto him, yet aſſoon as he ſaw it to be the will of God, he was obedient unto it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. When God commanded him to ſacrifice his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his only Son that was now left, and him by whom the Promiſe was to be fulfilled, that his Seed ſhould be as the Stars of Heaven for multitude, yea, from whom he was to proceed, in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, to wit, Chriſt; though this might ſeem to croſs both Nature and Grace, both Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Religion, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was ready to obey the will of God in this alſo, and to do what he commanded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. So <hi>David</hi> was one that would do all Gods will, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.22. And it is ſaid of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that <hi>they walked in all the Commandments and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord,</hi> Luk 1.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God requires ſuch obedience: <hi>Walk ye in all the wayes that I have commanded you,</hi> Jer. 7.23. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things that I have commanded you,</hi> Mat. 28.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God delights in ſuch obedience, and in thoſe that perform it: <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 5.29. In this reſpect <hi>Abraham</hi> was called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> Iſa. 41.8. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.3.<note place="margin">See Joh. 15.14.</note> And for this very reaſon did God call <hi>David</hi> a man after his own heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God doth promiſe mercy and ſalvation upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditition of ſuch obedience. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die,</hi> Ezek. 18.21.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Without ſuch obedience a man cannot have that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52962:163"/> hope which maketh not aſhamed. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect to all thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119, 6.</p>
               <p>The grounds and reaſons of the Doctrine are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mans holineſs muſt be conformable to Gods holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Be ye followers of God as dear children,</hi> Epheſ. 5.1. <hi>Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> Mat. 5.48. Now <hi>God is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why obedience muſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</note> Pſal. 145.17. And ſo ought all to be, and ſo all that deſire to be ſaved, muſt have a care to be. <hi>As he who hath called you is holy, ſo be ye alſo holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The holineſs of a Chriſtian muſt be conformable to Chriſts holineſs. <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. Now Chriſt was holy in all things: <hi>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth us</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to fulfil all righteouſneſs,</hi> Mat. 3.15. <hi>He was obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.8. This ſhould be the care of every one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelf to be Chriſts, even to be thus holy and obedient as Chriſt was. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf to walk even as he walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Partial obedience argues hypocrifie; if the heart be ſound and upright, it will yeeld entire and univerſal obedience. <hi>Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> unto God) <hi>that I may not be aſhamed,</hi> Pſal. 119.80. And v. 6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when I have reſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi> By which verſes compared together, it appeareth, that then the heart is ſound, when there is a reſpect unto all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. [See Serm. 4. Uſe 1. the firſt mark of uprightneſs.]</p>
               <p n="4">4. Partial obedience is indeed no obedience; it is no true obedience, except it be univerſal. <hi>All that the Lord hath ſaid, will we do, and be obedient,</hi> Exod. 24.7. They only are indeed obedient, who have a care to do all that is commanded. For to obey, is to do that which is commanded, becauſe it is commanded: though
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52962:163"/> the thing done be commanded, yet if it be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done becauſe it is commanded, it is no obedience. Now if this be the nature of obedience, then where obedience is indeed, it is not partial, but univerſal. For he that doth any one thing that is commanded,<note place="margin">A quatenus ad omne valet conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quentia.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is commanded, will be careful to do every thing that is commanded; there being the ſame reaſon for all. He that hath no regard to any one thing which he knoweth God doth enjoyn, though he do never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things which are required of him, yet in doing them, he doth not obey God; for he doth them not becauſe God commandeth them: for then he would alſo do that which he neglecteth, ſeeing he knoweth that God doth command that as well as the other. Hereupon Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point,</hi> (to wit, ſo as to have no reſpect unto it) <hi>is guilty of it. For he that ſaid, Do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the Law,</hi> Jam. 2.10, 11.

                  </label> True it is; but let the ſincere ſervants of God know to their comfort, that although they be full of failings and imperfections, yet their hearts being bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, it being their deſire and endeavor to do the will of God entirely, as well in one thing as in another, God will pardon their failings, and paſs by their imperfections, <hi>he will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his ſon that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3.17. Though a Father ſee his Son to fail and come ſhort in that which he enjoyns him to do, yet knowing that his deſire is to ſerve and pleaſe him, he will not be rigid and ſevere with him, but will be indulgent unto him, and will ſpare him: and ſo will God his Children, to wit, ſuch as are not <hi>lying children,</hi> Iſa. 30 9. but are <hi>children that will not lye,</hi> Iſa. 63.8 ſuch children as are ſincerely, though weakly and imperfectly obedient.

               <p>But let none catch at this, when it doth not belong unto them. Thine obedience muſt in deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor be univerſal; thou muſt ſet thy ſelf to obey in <label type="milestone">

               <p n="1">1.

Some obſerve the one, ſome the other; but in not obſerving both, they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obſerve neither. <hi>Abſalom</hi> pretended that he had vowed a Vow, and muſt needs go to <hi>Hebron</hi> to pay it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.7. It was only a pretence; but had it been ſo indeed, yet not regarding his duty to <hi>David,</hi> his King and Father, his piety towards God could not be right; <hi>If a man ſay</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>John) I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? And this Commandment have we from him, that who loveth God, love his brother alſo,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20, 21. Now <hi>love</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>worketh no evil to his neighbor,</hi> Rom. 13.10. Yea, it worketh good, for (as he alſo telleth us) <hi>Charity is kinde,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4. On the other ſide, ſome are careful to deal juſtly with men, but neglect the duties of Gods immediate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice, regard not the Word, Sacraments and Prayer: but, <hi>the first and great Commandment is this, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy minde.

So it was the commendation of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that when the Decree was made, that whoſoever did make a requeſt to any god, but to the King, he ſhould be caſt into the Den of Lyons, yet he would not neglect his duty unto God, but prayed and made ſupplication unto him three times a day, as he had done before, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7, 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do ye obſerve great things as well as ſmall? The Scribes and Phariſees were punctual and preciſe in leſſer matters; they would pay Tythe of Mint and Anniſe and Cummin; but they omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Do ye obſerve ſmall things as well as great? Some, if they have reſpect to things of greater concernment, think they may take their liberty in leſſer matters, either to obſerve them, or not, as they pleaſe. But though ſome things are ſmall in compariſon of other things; yet nothing is ſimply and abſolutely to be accounted ſmall, that God commandeth; not ſo ſmall, but that it ought to be obſerved. <hi>Theſe things ought ye to have done,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt, to wit, the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith) <hi>and not to leave the other undone,</hi> to wit, the leſſer matters, as the tything of Mint, and Anniſe and Cummin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Do ye not obey God, ſo as to obey ſome luſt alſo? This is not indeed to obey God at all. <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> Mat. 6.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip

                  </gap> that it is ſo, appears many wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By plain teſtimonies of Scripture, as here in the Text, and ſo in other places. <hi>He ſhall never ſuffer the righteous to be moved,</hi> Pſal. 55.22. <hi>The root of the righteous ſhall not be moved,</hi> Prov. 12.3. <hi>The righteous is an everlaſting
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52962:166"/> foundation,</hi> Prov. 10.25. <hi>Surely he ſhall not be moved for ever,</hi> Pſal 112.6. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> Joh. 6.56.

And the ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever: but the Son abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for ever,</hi> Joh. 8.34, 35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Similitudes and Reſemblances, which are uſed to ſet forth the eſtate of the godly. He is <hi>like a tree planted by the River ſide, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe leaf doth not fade,</hi> Pſal. 1.3. He is compared to <hi>a green Olive-tree,</hi> he never withereth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.8. He is <hi>as Mount Sion, that cannot be moved, but abideth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 125 1. He is <hi>like a houſe built upon a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some may ſay, That theſe Teſtimonies and Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances do not prove that the godly ſhall certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the eſtate of Grace, but only that ſuch as are, and continue godly, are ſure to be happy.</p>
               <p>But firſt, This exception hath no place in reſpect of ſome of the Teſtimonies and Reſemblances that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; as namely, thoſe Teſtimonies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.56. &amp; 8. 34, 35. and that Reſemblance, <hi>Luk</hi> 8 15.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, Neither is the exception of force in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any of the Teſtimonies and Reſemblances pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged. For they all ſpeak of the ſtability and firmneſs of the righteous; and if the happineſs of the righteous be directly intended, yet their perſeverance in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is by conſequence aſſerted. For if the righteous ſhould fall from their righteouſneſs, then ſhould they miſs of their happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The perſeverance of the Saints is proved alſo by the confidence, which they being guided by the Spirit of God, have expreſſed. <hi>I will abide in thy Tabernacle for ever,</hi> Pſal. 61.4. <hi>I am like a green Olive-tree in the houſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52962:167"/> of God: I truſt in the mercy of God for ever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 52.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me: becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life,</hi> v. 10. It was ſpoken of the head, Chriſt; but it is alſo true of every member, every true Chriſtian. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine; or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? (As it is written, For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, and are counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter. Nay, in all theſe things we are more then Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours through him that loved us. For I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom 8.35, 36, 37, 38, 39. <hi>We know, that when this earthly houſe of our tabernacle is diſſolved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternall in the heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>I know that this ſhall turn to my ſalvation through your prayer, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Christ; According to my earneſt expectation, and my hope, that in nothing I ſhall be aſhamed, but that with all boldneſs, as alwayes, ſo now alſo Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or death,</hi> Phil. 1.19, 20. <hi>And the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and preſerve me to his heavenly Kingdom.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.18.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The nature of Faith, which the godly are endued with, doth prove their perſeverance. The godly have <hi>the ſame ſpirit of Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. Now <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. But if the Saints might fall away, then Faith ſhould rather be a ſhadow then a ſubſtance; rather a blank then an evidence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The perſeverance of the godly is proved by the nature of that hope which they have. <hi>We are ſaved by hope,</hi> Rom. 8.24. <hi>And hope maketh not aſhamed,</hi> Rom. 5.5. Therefore though the Moraliſt ſay; that hope imports
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52962:167"/> uncertainty, yet it is not ſo in reſpect of true Chriſtian hope, it is ſure and certain; it is <hi>the anchor of the ſoul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spes eſt boni incerti nomen. <hi>Sen. Epiſt. 10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and entreth into that within the veil,</hi> Heb. 6.19. But if the godly might fall away and periſh, their hope were but a poor anchor to ſtay their ſouls by, and they ſhould be aſhamed of it, becauſe they ſhould hope for that which they ſhould not enjoy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The nature of grace in general, doth prove that the godly ſhall perſevere. It is compared to <hi>a Well of water, ſpringing up unto everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 4.14. It is <hi>incorruptible ſeed,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. Therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>he that is born of God doth not commit ſin,</hi> (to wit, not ſo as the unregenerate do, not ſo as to give themſelves up to the practice of ſin) for his ſeed remaineth in him: and he <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> (to wit, in that manner) <hi>becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That peace, which the godly have, is an argument of their perſeverance. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 5.1. This peace is a laſting peace, and not mutable and fading as the peace of the World is. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you: let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,</hi> Joh. 14.27.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The joy which the Godly have, or may have, is a perſevering joy; and therefore it alſo doth prove their perſeverance. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwayes; and again I ſay, Rejoyce.</hi> Phil. 4.4. <hi>In whom, though now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy no man taketh from you,</hi> Joh. 16.22.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Godly ſhall perſevere becauſe of Gods power.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52962:168"/> 
                  <hi>My Father which gave them me, is greater then all: and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand,</hi> Joh. 10.29. <hi>Yea, he ſhall be holden up: for God is able to make him ſtand,</hi> Rom. 14.2. <hi>Nevertheleſs,</hi> (though I ſuffer theſe things) <hi>I am not aſhamed; for I know whom I have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through Faith unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. If the Godly were to ſtand by their own ſtrength, they would ſoon fall: but God by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power doth uphold them: and therefore they cannot fall, not ſo as utterly to fall away. <hi>Though he fall,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> of a righteous man) <hi>he ſhall not be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand,</hi> Pſal. 37.24. <hi>Now unto him, that is able to keep you from falling,</hi> &amp;c. Jude v. 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Gods power, ſo his purpoſe is a reaſon of the perſeverance of the Godly: as God is able to keep them from falling away, ſo he will keep them, he hath purpoſed and determined to do it. They are <hi>called according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. As Gods power cannot be reſiſted, ſo his purpoſe cannot be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Many devices are in the heart of a man: but the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand,</hi> Prov. 19.21. <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure,</hi> ſaith he, Iſa. 46.10. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate,</hi> (that is, purpoſe to ſave) <hi>them he alſo called,</hi> viz. effectually, ſo as to bring them to that happineſs unto which he doth call them, as the words following do ſhew, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Fear not little flock; it is your Fathers pleaſure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him,</hi> Joh. 17.2. <hi>The foundation of the Lord abideth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Godly ſhall perſevere, becauſe of Gods promiſe. As the purpoſe of God ſhall ſtand, ſo his promiſe ſhall
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52962:168"/> be performed. <hi>For he is faithful that hath promiſed,</hi> Heb. 10.24. <hi>He is not as man that he ſhould lye, nor as the ſon of man that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it? hath he ſpoken it, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Num. 23.19. Now as God hath purpoſed to ſave the Godly, and to keep them from falling away, ſo he hath alſo promiſed to do it. <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt for him. — My loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him.</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 89.28, 33. <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32.39, 40.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Godly are Chriſt's purchaſe, and therefore they are ſure to perſevere. <hi>He hath purchaſed his Church with his own blood,</hi> Act. 20.28. And ſurely, he will not ſuffer his blood to be ſpilt in vain; he will not ſuffer them to periſh, whom he hath purchaſed at ſo dear a rate. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> Iſa 53.11. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> ſaith he, Joh. 10.15. <hi>And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand,</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt's prayer and interceſſion for the Godly, doth alſo make ſure their perſeverance. As Chriſt hath payed for his members, ſo he hath prayed for them: and his prayer is effectual. <hi>I pray for them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Luk. 22.31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me: for they are thine,</hi> Joh. 17.9. <hi>Keep through thine own Name thoſe whom thou haſt given me,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 11. <hi>I pray not, that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the evil,</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word,</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo, whom
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52962:169"/> thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory,</hi> verſ. 24. Still alſo in Heaven doth Chriſt make interceſſion for his members, preſenting himſelf, and his merits unto God for them. <hi>He is entred into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, yea, rather that is riſen again, who alſo is at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.34.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Holy Ghoſt ſanctifying and ſealing the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth alſo make their condition firm and ſure. <hi>God hath choſen you unto ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.13. God by his Spirit doth ſanctifie thoſe whom he hath choſen, and ſo doth ſet them apart, and ſeal them for his own, and as thoſe whom he will have a care of, and keep ſafe. In this reſpect the Spirit is compared to a ſeal, whereby a thing is known to whom it doth belong, and alſo is preſerved and kept ſafe. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.22. <hi>In whom alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. 1.13, 14. In which places, alſo the Spirit, which is given unto Believers, is compared to <hi>an earneſt,</hi> which doth ſo confirm a bargain, and make it ſure, that it is a part of it. So the Spirit, that is, the Grace of the Spirit, which God doth here give unto Believers, is a part of that glorious inheritance, which they ſhall fully enjoy hereafter. For Grace is an inchoation of glory: and glory is a conſummation of Grace. And hence Believers are ſure of ſalvation, becauſe they have it already in part, though but in ſmall part to what they ſhall have, yet in part they have it, becauſe they have
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52962:169"/> the earneſt of it. And that doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them of all the reſt,<note place="margin">

               <p>THe point concerning the perſeverance of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (who ſhall never be moved ſo as to fall from that ſtate of Grace, whch they are in) I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and for the vindicating of the truth, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing of thoſe that do oppoſe it, I have anſwered one Objection that is made againſt it. There are yet many other Objections, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>2</label> which it is meer to anſwer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Therefore, the Adverſaries of this Doctrine object, that ſome are compared to the ſtonie ground, to wit, <hi>ſuch as hear the Word, and anon with joy receive it: Yet have they no root in themſelves, but endure only for a while: for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word, by and by they are offended,</hi> Mat. 13.20, 21. <hi>For a while they believe, and in time of temptation they fall away,</hi> Luk. 8.13.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:52962:171"/>
               <p>But all Believers are not ſuch as we ſpeak of, to wit, ſuch as are engrafted into Chriſt by a living and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith. <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in ſome ſenſe a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. but not ſuch a Believer, verſ. 21. &amp; 23. So neither are they ſuch Believers, who are compared to the ſtonie ground: for they are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who <hi>with an honeſt and good heart receive the Word,</hi> Luk. 8.15. The ſame alſo appears by this, that they are ſaid <hi>to have no root;</hi> that argues that their Faith is but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, it is not rooted in the heart, as true juſtifying Faith is. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Again, it is objected, that Gods Covenant is not ſuch, that he will ſimply and abſolutely ſave, but that he will ſave thoſe that Believe and obey, and that ſo as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in Faith and obedience to the end. <hi>By which alſo ye are ſaved, if ye keep in memory,</hi> (or as the Margent hath it, <hi>if ye hold fast) what I preached unto you, unleſs ye have believed in vain,</hi> 1 Cor 15.2. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory and honour and immortality,</hi> (God will render) <hi>eternal life,</hi> Rom. 2.7. <hi>Shall he proſper that doth ſuch things? Shall he break the Covenant, and be delivered?</hi> Ezek. 17.15. <hi>When I ſhall ſay to the righteous, that he ſhall ſurely live: if he truſt to his own righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity, all his righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembred; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he ſhall dye for it,</hi> Ezek. 33.13. <hi>When the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous turneth from his righteouſneſs, and committeth iniquity, he ſhall even dye thereby,</hi> verſ. 18. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith: but if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away,</hi> Joh. 15.2. <hi>It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were partakers of the holy Ghost, And have taſted the good Word of God, and the powers of the World to come, If they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance,</hi> &amp;c. Heb 6.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer to this Objection: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> 1. Gods Covenant
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52962:172"/> is not only to ſave thoſe that believe and obey, but alſo to make his Elect ſo to believe and obey, that they ſhall be ſaved: <hi>I will put my Law in their inward part, and write it in their hearts,</hi> Jer. 31.33. <hi>A new heart will I give unto you, and a new Spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the ſtonie heart out of your fleſh, and will give you a heart of fleſh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32.40.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The places objected, do not prove that any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers, and ſuch as are regenerate can fall away. That in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.15. is concerning the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who brake his covenant with the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to whom he had ſworn to be ſubject, yet afterward he rebelled againſt him. What is this to the purpoſe? Doth this argue, that one who is in the ſtate of Grace and ſalvation, may fall from it? Theſe places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. ſhew how ſalvation it to be obtained, and by whom, to wit, ſuch as perſevere: but they do not ſhew, that any being juſtified and ſanctified, ſhall not perſevere. The other places alſo ſhew what ſhall befal back-ſliders, but not that any truly righteous ſhall back-ſlide ſo as to prove unrighteous and periſh. It is granted, that ſome, who are after a ſort Believers and righteous, may fall from that faith and righteouſneſs, which they have: but this is denyed of thoſe who have received Chriſt into their hearts by Faith, and are regenerated by his Spirit. Neither do thoſe places of Scripture ſpeak of ſuch, (if they ſpeak of ſuch as actually fall away) but of ſuch as are in Chriſt onely by profeſſion; as that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. or are righteous with external righteouſneſs; as that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13, 18. or have ſome ſuperficiarie Grace in them; as that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Bert. ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note>But the beſt are warned to take heed of apoſtacie and falling away. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by Faith: be not high minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11.20. <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth,

               <p>But theſe admonitions and exhortations are no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that true Saints may fall away; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> but they are means to preſerve them from falling away. God doth work by means; and intending the end, he doth ordain means whereby to attain unto it; ſo that though he will ſurely accompliſh the end, yet he will do it by thoſe means, which he hath ordained for it. God had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſave all that were with <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſhip, to ſave them (I mean) from drowning; and ſo much he let <hi>Paul</hi> know, and <hi>Paul</hi> aſſured thoſe in the Ship that it ſhould be ſo: Yet when the Ship-men were about to flie out of the Ship, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Centurion and Soldiers, <hi>Except theſe abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> Act. 27.23, 24, 25, 30, 31. One anſwers to this place,<note place="margin">J.G. of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> that the purpoſe to ſave thoſe that were with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Ship was conditional, to wit, if they did abide in the Ship. And that indeed is true; but ſo alſo is this, that God did alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they ſhould abide in the Ship; and ſo his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſaving them was in effect abſolute, becauſe though a condition was required, yet the fulfilling of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was alſo determined. So God purpoſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to reſtore <hi>Ezekiah</hi> to his health, and to add unto his days fifteen years, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.5. Yet <hi>Ezekiah</hi> was to uſe means for his recovery, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. and ſo (no doubt) for his preſervation. Our Saviour warns all <hi>to beware of falſe prophets,</hi> Mat. 7.15. Yet ſpeaking of falſe prophets, he ſaith, <hi>If it were poſſible, they ſhall deceive the very Elect,</hi> Mat. 24.24. intimating that the Elect ſhall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (ſo as to be wholly vanquiſhed and overcome) by them. To this place alſo one anſwers,<note place="margin">J.G. of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> That the words do not import ſo much, becauſe that expreſſion <hi>[if it were poſſible]</hi> is uſed in other places, where no impoſſibility of the thing ſpoken of is intimated; as <hi>Act.</hi> 20.16.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52962:173"/> and 27.39. But though thoſe words <hi>[if it were poſſible]</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in themſelves conſidered, do not imply an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that which is ſpoken of, yet in that ſpeech of our Saviour, by the circumſtances of it, they do imply as much. For our Saviour ſpeaks of the Elect, who if they ſhould be deceived and overcome by falſe Prophets, Gods purpoſe concerning their ſalvation ſhould fail, and ſo the foundation of the Lord ſhould not abide ſure, he ſhould not know who are his, neither ſhould his counſel ſtand, and he do all his pleaſure: and therefore thoſe words, <hi>if it were poſſible,</hi> &amp;c. muſt needs import ſo much, that it is not poſſible for the Elect to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

               <p>The Devil is the adverſary of Gods people; <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil your adverſary,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. Therefore he is called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> which is as much as a hater, an enemy or adverſary.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52962:175"/> This Adverſary is ſtrong; he is compared to <hi>a ſtrong man,</hi> Luk. 11.21. And to a <hi>Lyon,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. He is a fierce Adverſary; therefore he is compared to a <hi>roaring Lyon,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. He is a malitious Adverſary; <hi>he goes about ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. He is a ſubtil Adverſary; therefore he is called <hi>a Serpent,</hi> yea, <hi>the old Serpent,</hi> Rev. 20.2. Yet with all his ſtrength, fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, malice and ſubtilty, he ſhall not prevail over the Godly. Though the Devil be ſtrong, yet Chriſt is ſtronger, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.22. Though the Devil be fierce, malitious and ſubtil, yet Chriſt will have a care of thoſe that are his; he will keep them, that Satan ſhall not be able to do them hurt. <hi>Simon, Simon,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Peter) Satan hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not,</hi> Luk. 22.31, 32. And ſo Chriſt alſo prayed for all that belong unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9, 20. Though this old Serpent, the Devil, bruize the heel of Gods people; yet Chriſt hath bruized, and will bruize his head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Chriſt took upon him our nature, <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2.14. He hath vanquiſhed Satan, and triumphed over him on the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. Therefore Satan ſhall not vanquiſh thoſe that are Chriſts; he ſhall not triumph over them. The Apoſtle comforts Believers, ſaying, <hi>The God of peace ſhall brize Satan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom 16.20.</p>
               <p>The World alſo is the Adverſary of Gods people. <hi>If ye were of the World,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to his Diſciples) <hi>the World would love his own: but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore doth the World hate you,</hi> Joh. 15.19. So in his prayer, that he made for them to his Father, <hi>The World hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the World, as I am not of the World,</hi> Joh. 17.14. The World is a dangerous enemy, ſometimes frowning and perſecuting, ſometimes fawning and alluring, that if it cannot prevail one way, it may prevail another way: yet ſhall it not any way prevail
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52962:176"/> againſt the true Saints and Servants of God. It ſhall not by troubles and perſecutions. <hi>In the World ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> (ſaid our Saviour) <hi>but be of good comfort, I have overcome the World,</hi> Joh. 16.33. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or distreſs, or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? (As it is written, For thy ſake, we are killed all the day long, and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter.) Nay in all theſe things we are more then Conquerors through him that loved us,</hi> Rom. 8.35, 36, 37. Neither ſhall the World prevail over the Godly by flatteries and allurements. Chriſt hath prayed for them, that though they be in the World, yet they may not be drawn away and overcome with the evil of it. <hi>I pray not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the World, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the evil,</hi> Joh. 17.15. <hi>Exceeding great and pretious promiſes are given unto them, that by theſe they might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the World through luſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, over commeth the World: and this is the victory that overcommeth the World, even our Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4.</p>
               <p>The Fleſh is likewiſe an adverſary to the Godly, their carnal and corrupt nature that is ſtill in them. For in the beſt that are upon Earth, there is Fleſh as well as Spirit, corruption as well as Grace. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit luſteth againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other; ſo that ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the things that ye would,</hi> Gal. 5.17. This being a <hi>Delilah,</hi> a boſom enemy, is therefore the moſt perillous. This is that which brings the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> upon <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which gives Satan and the World much advantage: were we free from our own corruptions, we were not in ſuch danger of Satans and the Worlds temptations. Yet neither ſhall this Adverſary prevail againſt the Godly. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the Fleſh, with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>Our old man is crucified with
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52962:176"/> him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin,</hi> Rom. 6 6. <hi>Sin ſhall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you: for you are not under the Law, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grace,</hi> Rom 6.14. <hi>I know that in me, that is in my Fleſh, no good dwelleth. For the good that I would, I do not: and the evil that I would not, that I do. — O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me fr m the body of this death? I thank, God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 7.18, 19 24, 25. Thus however the Godly are tempted, however they are troubled, they may have comfort, they are built upon a ſure foundation, and ſhall ſtand for ever.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> If the condition of the Godly be ſo ſafe and ſure, How ſhould this incite and provoke all to follow after godlineſs, the gain whereof is ſo certain, and ſo durable? Other things that men do ſo purſue, are, Firſt, Not ſure to be obtained: Many ſeek the profits and preferments of the World, and that with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that may be, and yet miſs of them: God doth often fruſtrate their labours, and diſappoint their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſo it may appear, that <hi>promotion commeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South: But God is the Judge; he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another,</hi> Pſal. 75.67.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, If the men of the World do obtain thoſe things which they ſeek after, yet it may be they have little joy of them. What joy had <hi>Ahab</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s Vineyard, when the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Haſt thou killed, and alſo taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion? — In the place where dogs licked the blood of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, <hi>ſhall dogs lick thy blood, even thine</hi> 1 King. 21.19. What joy had <hi>Gehezi</hi> of the gifts that he got of <hi>Naaman,</hi> when the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>The leproſie of</hi> Naaman <hi>ſhall cleave unto thee, and to thy ſeed for ever,</hi> 2 King. 5.27.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Theſe things at the beſt, can afford no true content, no ſolid comfort. He that hath theſe things in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:52962:178"/> moſt abundance, ſtill finds an emptineſs in himſelf, and remains unſatisfied. <hi>He that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver; nor he that loveth abundance, with encreaſe,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.10. So he that loveth honour, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or whatſoever the World doth afford. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.4, 5. &amp; <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. If the men of the World do feel a kinde of content for a while in thoſe things which they enjoy, yet it laſts not: when trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction comes, the things wherein they ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot ſupport them, and bear up their ſpirits, but they ſinke under the burthen that is upon them. When <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was in the midſt of his pompous but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane jollity, no ſooner did the hand-writing appear in the Wall, but preſently <hi>his countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his loyns were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another,</hi> Dan. 5.6. <hi>Their ſilver and their gold ſhall not be able to deliver them in the day of the Lords wrath,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ezek. 7.19. and ſo alſo the Prophet <hi>Zephany,</hi> Zeph. 1.18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Worldly men have no ſure hold of thoſe things which they enjoy; they may be deprived of them every hour, and muſt ere long be deprived of them <hi>Lo,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) their good is not in their hand. — How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and how oft commeth their deſtruction upon them?</hi> Job 21.16, 17.

               <p>But Grace and Godlineſs, is quite of another nature: For 1. They that ſeek it, ſhall be ſure to obtain it: <hi>I love them that love me: and they that ſeek me early ſhall finde me,</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirst after righteouſneſs; for they ſhall be filled,</hi> Mat. 5.6. <hi>God will give his holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11.13.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:52962:178"/>2. As they that ſeek Grace and Godlineſs, ſhall obtain what they ſeek; ſo they ſhall have joy of that which they obtain. <hi>For godlineſs is great gain,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.6. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſe both of the life that now is, and alſo of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſhall be ſatisfied with it, ſo as to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent though they have nothing beſides. <hi>Godlineſs with contentment</hi> (bringing with it contentment) <hi>is great gain,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.6. <hi>As having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things,</hi> 2 Cor 6.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Grace and Godlineſs will ſupport the ſoul, and afford it comfort in the midſt of greateſt troubles and diſtreſſes. <hi>As ſorrowing, yet always rejoycing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10. <hi>We glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience experience; and experience hope: And hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5.3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Grace and Godlineſs is not tranſient and fading, but permanent and laſting. When the woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> thought much that Chriſt ſhould ask her ſome of the water of that Well that ſhe drew of, he ſaid unto her, <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirst again: But whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, it ſhall be in him a Well of water ſpringing up unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life,</hi> Joh. 4.13, 14. Therefore (as he alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors) <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth; but for that meat that endureth to eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6.27.</p>

This exhortation is not ſuperfluous: for though the Godly ſhall ſurely perſevere, yet not ſo, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be ſecure, and caſt off all care. No, they muſt be careful and diligent in the uſe of means, that they may perſevere. For (as hath been noted before) God doth work by means; and therefore it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to expect the end, without uſing the means whereby to attain unto it. As the natural life is not preſerved without means; ſo neither is the ſpiritual life. As whiles we are here upon Earth, our bodies muſt be looked to, and cared for, by the application of thoſe things which are needful for the body: ſo is it alſo in reſpect of our ſouls. They are therefore moſt vain, fooliſh and abſurd, who think they have attained to ſuch an eſtate of perfection, as now to have no need of Ordinances, or any means of Grace. Theſe give as much advantage unto Satan as may be: if he can but make us ſecure, and bring us to a neglect and contempt of the ordinary means of Grace, he deſires no more. Therefore the Apoſtle bids, <hi>Exhort one another daily, leſt any of you be hardned with the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3.13. And thoſe very words alſo ſhew, that exhortation

For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, then after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them,</hi> 2 Pet. 20.21.

                  </note> and in time will fall off. <hi>A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that ſet not their heart aright: and whoſe ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God,</hi> Pſal. 78.8. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they fought him,</hi>

                  </note> &amp;c. <hi>Nevertheleſs, they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongues: Their heart was not right with him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> Their unſoundneſs
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52962:180"/> was the cauſe of their unſtedfaſtneſs; the want of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity cauſed the want of ſtability. Nothing counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit will continue long. <hi>Ephraim</hi> compaſſing God about <hi>with lies,</hi> and the houſe of Iſrael <hi>with deceit,</hi> Hoſ. 11.12. their goodneſs was <hi>as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that paſſeth away,</hi> Hoſ. 6.4. Therefore if we would perſevere in that which is good, let us be ſincere in it: if we would avoyd apoſtacie, let us beware of hypocriſie. <hi>Quales haberi volumus, tales ſimus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambroſ.</note> Such as we would be accounted, let us be indeed. Let us walk as in the ſight of God, ſtudying to approve our ſelves unto him; and this will make us conſtant and ſtedfaſt in that which is good. <hi>I have kept thy precepts, and thy teſtimonies,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> unto God) <hi>for all my wayes are before thee,</hi> Pſal. 119.168. If we ſerve God in righteouſneſs and holineſs <hi>before him,</hi> that is, ſincerely and unfainedly, then ſhall we alſo ſerve him conſtantly and ſtedfaſtly, even <hi>all the days of our life,</hi> Luk. 1.74, 75. They that receive the Word <hi>in an honeſt and good heart,</hi> they bring forth fruit <hi>with patience,</hi> that is, with perſeverance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.15. Let us beware not only of groſs hypocriſie, ſuch as is in thoſe that purpoſely play the hypocrites, but alſo of ſecret and ſubtil hypocriſie, whereby ſome deceive not only others, but themſelves alſo, thinking that they are ſomething, when they are nothing, <hi>Gal</hi> 6.3. Let us take heed of giving entertainment to any luſt, of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any corruption to bear ſway in us. Let us give up our ſelves wholly unto God, to be ruled and governed by him in all things, ſaying with <hi>David, Search me O Lord and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 139.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A full purpoſe and reſolution to adhere unto God and to keep cloſe unto him. <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorted the Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord,</hi> Act. 11.23. <hi>O God,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52962:181"/> my heart is fixed,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 108.1. <hi>I have ſworn,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments,</hi> Pſal. 119.106. <hi>I have inclined my heart to perform thy Statutes alway, even unto the end,</hi> verſ. 112. But this reſolution muſt be well grounded: When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid that he would never deny Chriſt, he reſolved well in reſpect of the object of his reſolution, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ground of it: he builded too much upon himſelf, and his own ſtrength; which made him fall ſo fearfully as he did. Therefore (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts) <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quid in te ſtas, &amp; non ſtas? Projice te in illum, &amp;c. <hi>Aug.</hi>

But theſe things have I told you, that when the time cometh, ye may remember that I told you of them,</hi> Joh. 16.1, 2, 3, 4. And when great multitudes followed him, he turned unto them, and ſaid, <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, yea, and his own life alſo,</hi> (that is, hate all in compariſon of Chriſt, ſo as to be willing to part with all rather then him) <hi>he cannot be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Or elſe while the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an embaſſage, and deſireth conditions of peace.</hi> And then he makes the application, ſaying, <hi>So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath,</hi> (to wit, in preparation of heart, ſo as to be ready to forſake all, if for Chriſts ſake he be called to it) <hi>he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luk. 14.26.—31.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fear alſo is a means of perſeverance; not a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52962:182"/> and diſtruſtful fear, but that which doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a ſenſe of our own weakneſs, and ſo makes us flie unto God, and rely on his aſſiſtance: ſuch a fear as is oppoſed to high-mindedneſs, and hardneſs of heart. <hi>Thou ſtandest by Faith: be not high-minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11.20. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes: but he that hardneth his heart, ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſchief,</hi> Prov. 28.14 The want of this fear was the cauſe of <hi>Peters</hi> great and dangerous fall: he was too ſelf-confident, and too ſecure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. Fear alſo, as it is an awful and reverential dread of Gods Majeſty, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to perſeverance. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32.40.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To this end alſo, is required watchfulneſs. <hi>Watch and pray,</hi> that ye enter not into temptation, Mat. 26.41. <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13.</p>
               <p>This watchfulneſs conſiſts, 1. In avoyding as much as may be the occaſions of ſin. We pray unto God, <hi>not to lead us into temptation:</hi> Therefore neither muſt we caſt our ſelves into temptation. <hi>Salomon</hi> tels us of the fooliſh young man, that was inſnared by the Harlot, that <hi>he went the way to her Houſe,</hi> Prov. 7.8. He did not ſhun the occaſion as he ſhould have done, but did expoſe himſelf unto temptation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bids, <hi>Remove thy way far from her, and come not near the door of her Houſe,</hi> Prov. 5.8. And ſpeaking of the way of the wicked, <hi>Avoyd it,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs away,</hi> Prov. 4.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſiſting the firſt motions of ſin. This was
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52962:182"/> 
                  <hi>Joſephs</hi> prudence and pietie both, that he would not give any way to the evil ſuggeſtion and inſtigation of his Miſtriſs. <hi>And it came to paſs, as ſhe ſpake to Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph day by day, that he hearkned not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her,</hi> Gen. 39.10. The wicked are compared to the deaf Adder, that ſtoppeth her ear at the voyce of the Charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58 4, 5. But in this the Godly muſt be wiſe as Serpents, they muſt ſtop their ears at the charming of Satan, the World, and the Fleſh; they muſt take heed of being enchanted by them. The firſt motions of ſin are like ſparks falling among Hay, or Straw, or the like; if they be not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quenched, they will be likely to ſet all on fire. <hi>How long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Jer. 4.14. Evil thoughts will be creeping into us, but we muſt not give them entertainment, we muſt not ſuffer them to lodge within us. We muſt expel them, and drive them away, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did the fowls that moleſted his ſacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.11. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we think any ſin ſmall, ſo as to ſleight it, and make no reckoning of it, as if there were no danger in adventuring upon it. This is one of the wiles of the Devil, one of his methodical devices and ſubtilties,<note place="margin">

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52962:183"/> So <hi>Peter</hi> having firſt barely denyed Chriſt, afterward added Oathes and Execrations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This watchfulneſs, which is requiſite unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, conſiſts in repenting ſpeedily after that ſin is committed. Aſſoon as <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him for numbring the people, he preſently repented of it, ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned greatly in that which I have done: and now I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy ſervant; for I have done very fooliſhly,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.10. If we do not thus watch againſt ſin, but ſuffer it not only to ſeize on us, but alſo to ſettle in us; we ſhall ſoon be hardned with the deceitfulneſs of it, Heb. 3.13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That we may perſevere in that which is good, we muſt have a care not ſtand at a ſtay, but to go on ſtill,<note place="margin">Non progredi eſt regredi.</note> and to grow better and better. Not to go forward, is to go backward; and not to grow better, is to grow worſe. <hi>The Lord make you to encreaſe and abound in love one towards another, and towards all men, even as we do towards you: To the end that he may eſtabliſh your hearts unblameable in holineſs before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt with all his Saints,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.12, 13. <hi>Giving all diligence, add to your Faith, vertue; and to vertue, knowledge; And to knowledge, temperance; and to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, patience; and to patience, Godlineſs; And to Godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs; and to brotherly kindneſs, Charity. For if theſe things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. But he that lacketh theſe things, is blinde, and cannot ſee afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your Calling and your Election ſure: for
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52962:183"/> if ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.5.—10. <hi>Beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the errour of the wicked fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs. But grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.17, 18. See alſo 1 Theſſ. 3.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To meditate of the heavenly reward, this alſo is a great help to perſeverance. This will quicken and ſtir up unto diligence: this will animate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage againſt all difficulties. <hi>Be ſtedfaſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. <hi>Let us run with patience, the race that is ſet before us, Looking unto Jeſus, the Author and finiſher of our Faith, who for the joy that was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God,</hi> Heb. 12.1, 2. This made <hi>Moſes</hi> to chuſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; and to eſteem the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures in <hi>Egypt; he had reſpect to the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 11.25, 26. See alſo Phil. 3.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Conſtant attendance upon Gods Word, this is likewiſe neceſſary unto perſeverance. For the Word of God is not only to bring in, but alſo to carry on, and to build up unto perfection. <hi>And now, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified,</hi> Act. 20.32.
